This class contains methods used to calculate the aerodynamic coefficients of drag and lift. The airfoil model used is a NACA 2412 (naca2412-il) with RE=200,000 and Ncrit=9.  Returns the lift coefficient of the airfoil as a function of the angle of attack in radians. This is the curve-fitted representation of the extended polar. The extended polar was generated by extrapolating the data taken from the xFoil predicted polar for the airfoil under the given aerodynamic constraints using the Viterna method to extend the alpha range from -pi to pi radians.<br><br>  The mathematical representation of this method is a piecewise function consisting of a sum of sines and cosines generated through Fourier transform when<br><br> -0.196349541 rad &lt; alpha &lt;= -0.161442956 rad, when<br> -0.161442956 rad &lt; alpha &lt;= 0 rad, when<br> 0 rad &lt; alpha &lt;= 0.23536 rad, when<br> 0.2487090 rad &lt; alpha &lt;= 0.296706 rad, and when<br> 2.558 rad &lt; alpha &lt;= pi rad.<br><br>  The function consists of polynomial terms when<br><br> -pi rad &lt;= alpha &lt;= -0.196349541 rad, when<br> 0.23536 rad &lt; alpha &lt;= 0.248709 rad, and when<br> 0.296706 rad &lt; alpha &lt;= 2.558 rad.<br>  alpha Angle of attack in radians (any real angle).
