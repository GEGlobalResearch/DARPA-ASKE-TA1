Locality Search assists in the latter (see the following code block for example usage of locality search). \n",

For instance, an ambiguous variable \"a\" appears in the code and one wishes to get more context about. Assuming the availability of text associated with code (and it's extraction into a local graph using _t2t_), with the help of locality search API, users can look up which scientific models (aka equations) does \"a\" appear in.\n",
