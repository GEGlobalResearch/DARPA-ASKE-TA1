Density B-CONCEPT
is O
defined O
as O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
of O
an O
object O
divided O
by O
its O
volume, O
and O
most O
of O
our O
experiences O
with O
density B-CONCEPT
involve O
solids. O


We O
know O
that O
some O
objects O
are O
heavier O
than O
other O
objects, O
even O
though O
they O
are O
the O
same O
size. O


A O
brick O
and O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread O
are O
about O
the O
same O
size, O
but O
a O
brick O
is O
heavier--it O
is O
more O
dense. O


Among O
metals, O
aluminum O
is O
less O
dense O
than O
iron. O


For O
solids, O
the O
density B-CONCEPT
of O
a O
single O
element O
or O
compound O
remains O
fairly O
constant O
because O
the O
molecules O
are O
bound O
to O
one O
another. O


For O
example, O
if O
you O
found O
a O
pure O
gold O
nugget O
on O
the O
earth O
or O
you O
found O
a O
pure O
gold O
nugget O
on O
the O
moon, O
the O
measured O
density B-CONCEPT
would O
be O
nearly O
the O
same. O


An O
interactive O
simulator O
allows O
you O
to O
study O
how O
air O
density B-CONCEPT
varies O
with O
altitude. O


There O
are O
two O
ways O
to O
look O
at O
density: B-CONCEPT
-1 O
the O
small O
scale O
action O
of O
individual O
air O
molecules O
or O
-2 O
the O
large O
scale O
action O
of O
a O
large O
number O
of O
molecules. O


Starting O
with O
the O
small O
scale O
action, O
from O
the O
kinetic O
theory O
of O
gases, O
a O
gas O
is O
composed O
of O
a O
large O
number O
of O
molecules O
that O
are O
very O
small O
relative O
to O
the O
distance O
between O
molecules. O


The O
molecules O
are O
in O
constant, O
random O
motion O
and O
frequently O
collide O
with O
each O
other O
and O
with O
the O
walls O
of O
a O
container. O


Since O
density B-CONCEPT
is O
defined O
to O
be O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
divided O
by O
the O
volume, O
density B-CONCEPT
depends O
directly O
on O
the O
size O
of O
the O
container O
in O
which O
a O
fixed O
mass B-CONCEPT
of O
gas O
is O
confined. O


We O
have O
26 O
molecules O
of O
a O
mythical O
gas. O


Each O
molecule O
has O
a O
mass B-CONCEPT
of O
20 O
grams O
(.02 O
kilograms), O
so O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
of O
this O
gas O
is O
0.52 O
kg. O
We O
have O
confined O
this O
gas O
in O
a O
rectangular O
tube O
that O
is O
1 O
meter O
on O
each O
side O
and O
2 O
meters O
high. O


We O
are O
viewing O
the O
tube O
from O
the O
front, O
so O
the O
dimension O
into O
the O
slide O
is O
1 O
meter O
for O
all O
the O
cases O
considered. O


The O
volume O
of O
the O
tube O
is O
2 O
cubic O
meters, O
so O
the O
density B-CONCEPT
is O
0.26 O
kg/cubic O
meter. O


Notice O
that O
we O
have O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
material; O
it O
is O
just O
contained O
in O
a O
smaller O
volume. O


Turning O
to O
the O
larger O
scale, O
the O
density B-CONCEPT
is O
a O
state O
variable O
of O
a O
gas O
and O
the O
change O
in O
density B-CONCEPT
during O
a O
process O
is O
governed O
by O
the O
laws O
of O
thermodynamics. O


Actual O
molecules O
of O
a O
gas O
are O
incredibly O
small. O


(That's O
1 O
followed O
by O
23 O
zero's O
!! O


Because O
there O
are O
so O
many O
molecules, O
and O
the O
motion O
of O
each O
molecule O
is O
random, O
the O
value O
of O
the O
density B-CONCEPT
is O
the O
same O
throughout O
the O
container. O


Density B-CONCEPT
is O
a O
scalar O
quantity; O
it O
has O
a O
magnitude O
but O
no O
direction O
associated O
with O
it. O


As O
an O
example, O
consider O
Case O
#1, O
in O
which O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
is O
0.52 O
kg, O
the O
volume O
is O
2 O
cu O
m, O
and O
the O
density B-CONCEPT
is O
0.26 O
kg/cu O
m. O
If O
we O
sample O
a O
smaller O
volume O
of O
1 O
meter O
on O
a O
side O
as O
in O
Case O
#2, O
we O
will O
obtain O
the O
same O
density. B-CONCEPT


Another O
way O
to O
obtain O
the O
same O
density B-CONCEPT
for O
a O
smaller O
volume O
is O
to O
remove O
molecules O
from O
the O
container. O


In O
Case O
#4, O
the O
container O
is O
the O
same O
size O
as O
in O
Case O
#3, O
but O
the O
number O
of O
molecules O
(the O
mass) B-CONCEPT
has O
been O
decreased O
to O
only O
13 O
molecules. O


These O
rather O
simple O
examples O
help O
explain O
a O
fundamental O
effect O
that O
we O
see O
in O
nature. O


They O
are O
equivalent O
state O
variables. O


An O
important O
property O
of O
any O
gas O
is O
its O
pressure. O


Every O
day O
we O
hear O
the O
TV O
meteorologist O
give O
value O
of O
the O
barometric O
pressure O
of O
the O
atmosphere O
(29. O


Because O
understanding O
what O
pressure O
is O
and O
how O
it O
works O
is O
so O
fundamental O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
aerodynamics, O
we O
are O
including O
several O
slides O
on O
gas O

in O
the O

An O

how O

There O
are O
two O
ways O
to O
look O
at O
pressure: O
-1 O
the O
small O

action O
of O
individual O
air O

or O
-2 O
the O
large O
scale O
action O
of O
a O
large O
number O
of O

The O
momentum B-CONCEPT
of O
a O
single O
molecule O
is O
the O
product O
of O
its O
mass B-CONCEPT
and O
velocity, O
while O
the O
kinetic O
energy O
is O
one O
half O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
times O
the O
square O
of O
the O
velocity. O


As O
the O
gas O
molecules O
collide O
with O
the O
walls O
of O
a O
container, O
as O
shown O
on O
the O
left O
of O
the O
figure, O
the O
molecules O
impart O
momentum B-CONCEPT
to O
the O
walls, O
producing O
a O
force B-CONCEPT
perpendicular O
to O
the O
wall. O


The O
sum O
of O
the O
forces O
of O
all O
the O
molecules O
striking O
the O
wall O
divided O
by O
the O
area O
of O
the O
wall O
is O
defined O
to O
be O
the O
pressure. O


The O
pressure O
of O
a O

is O
then O
a O
measure O
of O
the O
average O
linear O
momentum B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
moving O
molecules O
of O
a O

The O
pressure O
acts O
perpendicular O
(normal) O
to O
the O
wall; O
the O
tangential O
(shear) O
component O
of O
the O
force B-CONCEPT
is O
related O
to O
the O
viscosity O
of O
the O
gas. O


Scalar O
Quantity O


While O
the O
gas O
as O
a O
whole O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
move, O
the O
individual O
molecules O
of O
the O
gas, O
which O
we O
cannot O
see, O
are O
in O
constant O
random O
motion. O


We O
can O
shrink O
the O
size O
of O
our O
container O
down O
to O
an O
infinitely O
small O
point, O
and O
the O
pressure O
has O
a O
single O
value O
at O
that O
point. O


It O
has O
a O
magnitude O
but O
no O
direction O
associated O
with O
it. O


If O
the O
gas O
as O
a O
whole O
is O
moving, O
the O
measured O
pressure O
is O
different O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O

The O

the O
gas O
produces O
an O
ordered O

The O

We O

some O
fundamentals O

in O
the O

to O

There O
are O
two O

-1 O
the O

the O

The O

of O
a O
gas O
is O
a O
measure O
of O
the O
average O

of O
the O

Turning O
to O
the O
large O
scale, O
the O
temperature B-CONCEPT
of O
a O
gas O
is O
something O
that O
we O
can O
determine O
qualitatively O
with O
our O

But O
to O
determine O
the O
temperature B-CONCEPT
quantitatively, O
to O
assign O
a O
number, O
we O
must O
use O
some O
principles O
from O
thermodynamics: O


You O
can O
explore O
the O
effects O
of O
temperature B-CONCEPT
on O
the O
pressure O
of O
a O
gas O
at O
the O

The O
second O

is O
the O

The O

Insulating O

while O
conducting O

very O

The O
Celsius O

designated O

uses O
the O

and O
the O
boiling O

as O
100 O
degrees O
with O
a O
linear O

So O
Fahrenheit O
adjusted O
the O
scale O
to O
make O
the O
boiling O
point O
of O
pure O
water O
212 O
and O
the O

32, O
which O
gave O
180 O
degrees O

180 O

because O
it O

the O

Because O
there O
are O
100 O

F O
between O

Since O

we O

we O

HISTORICAL O
NOTE: O
The O
theory O
which O
describes O
boundary O
layer O
effects O
was O
first O
presented O
by O
Ludwig O
Prandtl O
in O
the O
early O
1900's. O


He O
first O
proposed O
the O
interactively O
coupled, O
two O
layer O
solution O
which O
properly O
models O
many O
flow O
problems. O


In O
the O
mid O
1600's, O
Robert O
Boyle O
studied O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
pressure O
p O
and O
the O
volume O
V O
of O
a O
confined O
gas O
held O
at O
a O
constant O
temperature. B-CONCEPT


The O
initial O
state O
of O
the O
gas O
has O
a O
volume O
equal O
to O
4 O
cubic O
meters O
and O
the O
pressure O
is O
1 O
kilopascal. O


When O
the O
pressure O
is O
1.33 O
kilopascals O
the O
volume O
decreases O
to O
3 O
cubic O
meters. O


The O
product O
of O
pressure O
and O
volume O
remains O
a O
constant O
(4 B-EQUATION

Here O
is O
a O
computer O
animation O
of O
this O
process: O


To O
move O
a O
hypersonic O
cruising O
aircraft O
through O
the O
air, O
we O
have O
to O
use O
some O
kind O
of O
propulsion O
system O
to O
generate O
thrust. O


Because O
of O
the O
heat O
generated O
at O
stagnation O
points O
in O
a O
hypersonic O
flow, O
the O
gas O
turbine O
engine O
is O
not O
suited O
for O
this O
regime. O


A O
better O
choice O
for O
an O
air-breathing O
propulsion O
system O
would O
be O
a O
ramjet O
for O
Mach O
numbers O
less O
than O
6, O
and O
a O
scramjet O
for O
Mach O

greater O

Ramjets O
and O
scramjets O
rely O
on O
the O

the O

instead O
of O
using O
the O
mechanical O
compressor O
of O
a O
gas O
turbine. O


Gases O
have O
various O
properties O
that O
we O
can O
observe O
with O
our O
senses, O
including O
the O
gas O
pressure O
p, O
temperature B-CONCEPT
T, O
mass, B-CONCEPT
and O
volume O
V O
that O
contains O
the O
gas. O


Careful, O
scientific O
observation O
has O
determined O
that O
these O
variables O
are O
related O
to O
one O
another, O
and O
the O
values O
of O
these O
properties O
determine O
the O
state O
of O
the O
gas. O


Using O
the O
turbine O
engine O
station O

system, O
we O
begin O
with O
free O

at O

In O
cruising O

the O

slows O
the O

conditions. O


For O
an O

a O

describes O
the O
process. O


The O
non-isentropic O
effects O
are O
the O
result O
of O
shock O

in O
the O

As O
speed B-CONCEPT
increases, O
the O

through O
this O
shock O
eventually O
decrease O
the O
level O
of O

that O
can O
be O
achieved O
in O
the O
burner, O
and O
this O
sets O
a O
limit O
on O
the O

of O

The O
combustion O
process O
in O
the O
burner O
occurs O
at O
constant O
pressure O
from O

The O

increase O
depends O
on O
the O
type O
of O

used O
and O
the O
fuel-air O
ratio. O


For O
scramjets, O
there O
may O
be O
additional O
entropy O

associated O
with O
the O
mixing O
of O
the O

The O

the O
T-s O

is O
proportional O
to O
the O
useful O
work O
and O
thrust O
generated O
by O
the O

Most O
modern O

and O
military O
aircraft O
are O
powered O
by O
gas O
turbine O

which O
are O
also O
called O

The O

The O

For O

the O

To O

This O

An O
important O
property O
of O
any O
gas O
is O
its O
pressure. O


Because O
understanding O
what O
pressure O
is O
and O
how O
it O
works O
is O
so O
fundamental O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
aerodynamics O
and O
propulsion, O
we O
are O
including O
several O
slides O
on O
pressure O
in O
the O
Beginner's O
Guide. O


During O
collisions O
with O
the O
walls, O
there O
is O
a O
change O
in O
velocity O
and O
therefore O
a O
change O
in O
momentum B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
molecules. O


If O
a O
gas O
is O
static O
and O
not O
flowing, O
the O
measured O
pressure O
is O
the O
same O
in O
all O
directions. O


This O
leads O
to O
the O
definition O
of O
the O
dynamic O
pressure. O


To O
understand O
dynamic O
pressure, O
we O
begin O
with O
a O
one O
dimensional O
version O
of O
the O
conservation O
of O
linear O
momentum B-CONCEPT
for O
a O
fluid. O


Performing O
a O
little O
algebra: O


In O
particular, O
the O
aerodynamic O
forces O
acting O
on O
an O
object O
as O
it O
moves O
through O
the O
air O
are O
directly O
proportional O
to O
the O
dynamic O
pressure. O


As O
we O
have O
seen, O
dynamic O
pressure O
appears O
in O
Bernoulli's O
equation O
even O
though O
that O
relationship O
was O
originally O
derived O
using O
energy O
conservation. O


Gravity O
holds O
the O
atmosphere O
to O
the O
Earth's O
surface. O


The O
sun O
heats O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
Earth, O
and O
some O
of O
this O
heat O
goes O
into O
warming O
the O
air O
near O
the O
surface. O


Thus O
the O
air O
temperature B-CONCEPT
is O
highest O
near O
the O
surface O
and O
decreases O
as O
altitude O
increases. O


The O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound I-CONCEPT
depends O
on O
the O
temperature B-CONCEPT
and O
also O
decreases O
with O
increasing O
altitude. O


Therefore, O
air O
pressure O
decreases O
as O
we O
increase O
altitude. O


The O
air O
density B-CONCEPT
depends O
on O
both O
the O
temperature B-CONCEPT
and O
the O
pressure O
through O
the O
equation O
of O
state O
and O
also O
decreases O
with O
increasing O
altitude. O


Aerodynamic O
forces O
directly O
depend O
on O
the O
air O
density. B-CONCEPT


To O
help O
aircraft O

it O
is O
useful O

a O

Thermodynamics O
is O
a O
branch O

that O

In O

most O
interested O

in O
the O
study O

The O
first O
law O
of O
thermodynamics O
indicates O
that O
the O
total O

a O

conserved. O


Total O

includes O
the O

the O

the O

and O
the O

The O

that, O
while O
many O
physical O

the O

possible, O
the O
only O

For O
gases, O
there O
are O
two O
possible O
ways O
to O
evaluate O
the O
change O
in O
entropy. O


We O
begin O
by O
using O
the O
first O
law O
of O
thermodynamics: O


where O
p O
is O
the O
pressure O
and O
V O
is O
the O
volume O
of O

The O

If O
we O
have O

the O

the O

gives: O

dQ I-EQUATION

C I-EQUATION
(constant I-EQUATION

Similarly, O
for O
a O
constant O

process, O
the O
formulation O
of O
the O
first O
law O
gives: O


Similarly O
substituting O
the O
value O

from O
the O
equation O

and O
the O
definition O

dH O
we O
obtain O
the O
alternate O

Substituting O
these O

for O
dQ O
into O
the O

These O
equations O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
confusing, O
because O
we O
use O
the O
specific O
heat O
at O
constant O
volume O
when O
we O
have O
a O
process O
that O
changes O
volume, O
and O
the O
specific O
heat O
at O
constant O
pressure O
when O
the O
process O
changes O
pressure.To O
clarify O
matters, O
let's O
look O
at O
the O
first O
equation: O


If O
we O
have O
a O
constant O
volume O
process, O
the O
second O
term O
in O
the O
equation O
is O
equal O
to O
zero, O
since O
v2/v1 B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
1 I-EQUATION
We O
can O
then O
determine O
the O
value O
of O
the O
specific O
heat O
for O
the O
constant O
volume O
process. O


A O
similar O
type O
of O
argument O
can O
be O
made O
for O
the O
equation O
used O
for O
a O
change O
in O

You O
can O
explore O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
variables O
at O
the O
animated O

lab. O


If O
the O
pressure O
and O
temperature B-CONCEPT
are O
held O
constant, O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
gas O
depends O
directly O
on O
the O
mass, B-CONCEPT
or O
amount O
of O
gas. O


The O
product O
of O
pressure O
and O
volume O
is O
exactly O
a O
constant O
for O
an O
ideal O
gas. O


Finally, O
if O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
and O
pressure O
are O
held O
constant, O
the O
volume O
is O
directly O
proportional O
to O
the O
temperature B-CONCEPT

an O
ideal O

This O
relationship O
is O
called O
Charles O
and O
Gay-Lussac's O
Law O
in O
honor O
of O
the O
two O
French O
scientists O
who O
discovered O
the O
relationship. O


A O

The O

any O
two O
lines O
on O

a O
unique O

We O
also O

which O

equal O
to O
the O
universal O

divided O
by O
the O

Fortunately, O

In O
our O
observations O

the O
work O
done O
on, O

by O
a O

we O
have O
found O
that O
the O

depends O
not O
only O
on O
the O
initial O

final O
states O
of O
the O
gas O
but O
also O
on O
the O
process, O
or O
path O
which O
produces O
the O
final O
state. O


This O
suggests O
the O
existence O
of O
an O
additional O
variable, O
called O
the O
internal O
energy O
of O
the O
gas, O
which O
depends O
only O
on O
the O
state O
of O
the O
gas O
and O
not O
on O
any O
process. O


We O
have O
emphasized O
the O
words O
into O
and O
by O
in O
the O
definition. O


The O
internal O
energy O
is O
just O
a O
form O
of O
energy O
like O
the O
potential O
energy O
of O
an O
object O
at O
some O
height O
above O
the O
earth, O
or O
the O
kinetic O
energy O
of O
an O
object O
in O

Like O
potential O
energy, O
the O
internal O
energy O
can O
be O
stored O
in O
the O
system. O


The O
first O
law O

allows O
for O
many O
possible O
states O
of O
a O
system O
to O
exist, O
but O
only O
certain O
states O
are O
found O
to O
exist O
in O
nature. O


The O
second O
law O

helps O
to O
explain O
this O
observation. O


Scientists O
refer O
to O
a O
process O
which O
does O
not O
involve O
heat O
transfer O
as O
an O
adiabatic O
process. O


An O
important O
mathematical O
concept O
is O
the O
idea O
of O
function. O


Schematically, O
we O
can O
think O
of O
a O
function O
as O
a O
processor O
that O
takes O
in O
one O
(or O
more) O
input O
variables O
and O
produces O
an O
output O
variable. O


We O
call O
the O
output O
variable O
the O
dependent O
variable O
and O
the O
input O
variable O
is O
called O
the O
independent O
variable. O


Changing O
the O
value O
of O
an O
independent O
variable O
produces O
a O
change O
in O
the O
value O
of O
the O
dependent O
variable O
that O
is O
always O
the O
same. O

At O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
slide O
we O
have O
listed O
some O
examples O
of O
functions O
that O
occur O
in O
aerospace O
engineering. O


The O
trigonometric O
functions O
sine, O
cosine, O
and O
tangent O
relate O
the O
various O
sides O
and O
angles O
of O
a O
triangle. O


So O
we O
can O
write O
the O
functions O
as: O


where O
the O
value O
of O
X O
is O
an O
angle O
and O
the O
value O
of O
Y, O
W, O
and O
Z O
are O
numbers. O


Y B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
X! I-EQUATION

3 O
* O
2 O
* O
1 O
= O
24 O


is O
made O
by O
adding O
powers O
of O
X. O
The O
function O
here O
is: O


Y B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
X^n I-EQUATION


where O
n O
is O
any O
number. O


Y B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
X^2 I-EQUATION


Y B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
sqrt(X) I-EQUATION


Since O
lift O
and O
drag O
depend O
on O
the O
square O
of O
the O
velocity, O
we O
often O
use O
square O
roots O
to O
solve O
velocity O
problems. O


It O
returns O
the O
angle O
Y O
whose O
tangent O
is O
X. O
There O
are O
inverses O
for O
the O
sine O
and O
cosine O
as O
well. O


The O
rate O
is O
expressed O
as O
another O
function O
called O
a O
differential O
and O
the O
rate O
is O
the O
slope O
of O
the O
graph O
of O
the O
function. O


If O
we O
have O
a O
function O
Y B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
f(X), I-EQUATION
then O
the O
slope O
of O
the O
function O
is O
called O
Z O
and; O


Y B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
exp(X) I-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
d[exp(X)]/dX I-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
dY/dX I-EQUATION


The O
inverse O
of O
the O
exponential O
function O
is O
the O
logarithmic O
function O
with O
the O
symbol O
ln(X). O


The O
ln O
function O
appears O
in O
many O
thermodynamics O
problems, O
such O
as O
calculating O
the O
change O
in O
the O
entropy O
of O
a O
gas O
during O
a O
thermodynamic O
process. O


The O
cosh O
(X) O
function O
on O
the O
slide O
is O
the O
hyperbolic O
cosine O
function. O


Fluid O
Dynamics O
involves O
the O
interactions O
between O
an O
object O
and O
a O
surrounding O
fluid, O
a O
liquid, O
or O
a O
gas. O


Fluid O
dynamics O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
devlopment O
of O
thrust O
in O
a O
gas O
turbine O
engine, O
and O
in O
the O

. O


Under O
normal O
conditions, O
matter O
exists O
as O
either O
a O
solid, O
a O
liquid, O
or O
a O
gas. O


Scientists O
refer O
to O
the O
large O
scale O
motion O
of O
the O
gas O
as O
the O
macro O
scale O
and O
the O
individual O
molecular O
motions O
as O
the O
micro O
scale. O


Macro O
scale O
and O
micro O
scale O
investigations O
are O
just O
two O
views O
of O
the O
same O
thing. O


The O
atmosphere O
is O
treated O
as O
a O
uniform O
gas O
with O
properties O
that O
are O
averaged O
from O
all O
the O
individual O
components O
(oxygen, O
nitrogen, O
water O
vapor...) O


. O


On O
the O
macro O
scale, O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
large O
scale O
effects O
that O
we O
can O
measure, O
such O
as O
the O
gas O
velocity, O
the O
pressure O
exerted O
on O
the O
surroundings, O
or O
the O
temperature B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
gas. O


A O
gas O
does O
not O
have O
a O
fixed O
shape O
or O
size O
but O
will O
expand O
to O
fill O
any O
container. O


Some O
simplified O
versions O
of O
the O
equations O
can O
be O
solved O
to O
model O
certain O
fluids O
problems. O


The O
model O
assumes O
that O
the O
molecules O
are O
very O
small O
relative O
to O
the O
distance O
between O
molecules. O


And O
these O
properties O
are O
related O
to O
the O
macro O
properties O
of O
density, B-CONCEPT
pressure, O
and O
temperature. B-CONCEPT


In O
a O
solid, O
the O
location O
of O
the O
molecules O
relative O
to O
each O
other O
remains O
almost O
constant. O


But O
in O
a O
fluid, O
the O
molecules O
can O
move O
around O
and O
interact O
with O
each O
other O
and O
with O
their O
surroundings O
in O
different O
ways. O


But O
the O
entire O
fluid O
can O
be O
made O
to O
move O
as O
well O
in O
an O
ordered O
motion. O


If O
the O
properties O
are O
transported O
by O
the O
ordered O
motion, O
the O
process O
is O
called O
convection. O


As O
an O
object O
moves O
through O
a O
gas, O
the O
viscosity O
(stickiness) O
of O
the O
gas O
becomes O
very O
important. O


Gas O
molecules O
stick O
to O
any O
surface, O
creating O
a O
layer O
of O
air O
near O
the O
surface, O
called O
a O
boundary O
layer O
that, O
in O
effect, O
changes O
the O
shape O
of O
the O
object. O


Compressibility O


As O
an O
object O
moves O
through O
a O
gas, O
the O
compressibility O
of O
the O
gas O
also O
becomes O
important. O


But O
for O
high O
speeds, O
some O
of O
the O
energy O
of O
the O
object O
goes O
into O
compressing O
the O
fluid, O
moving O
the O
molecules O
closer O
together O
and O
changing O
the O
gas O
density, B-CONCEPT
which O
alters O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
resulting O
force B-CONCEPT
on O
the O
object. O


This O
effect O
is O
more O
important O
as O
speed B-CONCEPT
increases. O


Near O
and O
beyond O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound I-CONCEPT
(about O
700 O
mph), O
shock O
waves O
are O
produced O
that O
affect O
both O
the O
lift O
and O
drag O
of I-CONCEPT
an O
object. O


In O
any O
propulsion O
system, O
a O
working O
fluid O
is O
accelerated O
by O
the O
system O
and O
the O
reaction O
to O
this O
acceleration B-CONCEPT
produces O
a O
force B-CONCEPT
on O
the O
system. O


We O
sometimes O
call O
this O
engine O
a O
jet O
engine. O


But O
unlike O
the O
rocket O
engine O
which O
must O
carry O
its O
oxygen O
for O
combustion, O
the O
turbine O
engine O
gets O
its O
oxygen O
from O
the O
surrounding O
air. O


All O
gas O
turbine O
engines O
have O
some O
parts O
in O
common, O
however. O


On O
the O
slide O
we O
see O
pictures O
of O
four O
different O
aircraft O
equipped O
with O
gas O
turbine O
engines. O


At O
the O

is O
a O

It O
spends O
most O
of O
its O
life O
in O
high O

cruise. O


At O
the O
lower O
right O
is O
a O
C-130 O
cargo O
aircraft. O


Like O
the O
DC-8, O
it O
carries O
cargo O
a O
long O
distance, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
have O
the O
high O
speed B-CONCEPT
requirement O
of O
the O
DC-8. O


At O
the O
upper O
right O
is O
a O
T-38 O
trainer. O

is O
an O
interactive O
Java O
applet O
which O
allows O
you O
to O
study O
different O
types O
of O
jet O
engines. O


In O
aerodynamics, O
we O
are O
most O
interested O
in O
the O
thermodynamics O
of O
propulsion O
systems O
and O
high O
speed B-CONCEPT
flows. O


The O
Zeroth O
Law O
of O
Thermodynamics O
introduces O
the O
concept O
of O
thermodynamic O

in O
which O
two O
objects O
have O
the O
same O

The O
heat B-CONCEPT

is O
a O
constant O
that O
tells O
how O
much O
heat B-CONCEPT
is O
added O
per O
unit O
temperature B-CONCEPT
rise. O


The O
temperature, B-CONCEPT
pressure, O
and O
volume O
of O
the O
gas O
determine O
the O
state O
of O
the O
gas. O


But O
the O
state O
of O
a O
gas O
can O
be O
changed O
in O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
ways. O


On O
another O
slide, O
we O
show O
how O
work O
done O
on O
a O
gas O
also O
changes O
the O
state O
of O
the O
gas. O


Exactly O
how O
the O
air O
re-acts O
to O
the O
aircraft O
depends O
upon O
the O
ratio O
of I-CONCEPT
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
the O
aircraft O
to O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound I-CONCEPT
through O
the O
air. O


There O
are O
some O
very O
special O
aircraft O
which O
fly O
in O
the O
high O
supersonic O
regime O
in O
which O
aircraft O
skin O
temperature B-CONCEPT
becomes O
high O
enough O
that O
special O
materials O
must O
be O
used, O
by O
is O
still O
low O
enough O
that O
the O
air O
molecules O
remain O
intact. O


Because O
lift O
and O
drag O
depend O
on O
the O
square O
of O
the O
velocity, O
these O
aircraft O
did O
not O
require O
large O
wing O
area O
in O
cruising O
flight. O


Like O
any O
supersonic O
aircraft, O
the O
wings O
are O
swept O
in O
planform O
to O
reduce O
drag. O


For O
Mach O
numbers O
greater O
than O
2.5, O
the O
frictional O
heating O
of O
the O
airframe O
by O
the O
air O
becomes O
high O
enough O
that O
light O
weight O
aluminum O
can O
not O
be O
used O
for O
the O
structure. O


Because O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
speed B-CONCEPT
ratio, O
aerodynamicists O
have O
designated O
it O
with O
a O
special O
parameter O
called O
the O
Mach O
number O
in O
honor O
of O
Ernst O
Mach, O
a O
late O
19th O
century O
physicist O
who O
studied O
gas O
dynamics. O


For O
aircraft O
speeds B-CONCEPT
which O
are O
much O
greater O
than O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound, I-CONCEPT
the O
aircraft O
is O
said O
to O
be O
hypersonic. O


Typical O
speeds O
for O
hypersonic O
aircraft O
are O
greater O
than O
3000 O
mph O
and O
Mach O
number O
M O
greater O
than O
five, O
M O
> O
5 O
We O
are O
going O
to O
define O
a O
high O
hypersonic O
regime O
at O
M O
> O
10 O
to O
account O
for O
re-entry O
aerodynamics. O


At O
low O
hypersonic O
speeds, O
the O
molecular O
bonds O
vibrate, O
which O
changes O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
forces O
generated O
by O
the O
air O
on O
the O
aircraft. O


The O
X-15 O
is O
shown O
on O
the O
figure. O


Recently, O
an O
un-manned O
X-43A O
used O
a O
scramjet, O
or O
supersonic O
combustion O
ramjet, O
to O
make O
two O
hypersonic O
flights; O
one O
at O
Mach O
7, O
the O
other O
at O
Mach O
10 O


While O
a O
ramjet O
is O
well O
suited O
for O
the O
cruise O
portion O
of O
the O
flight, O
a O
ramjet O
can O
not O
generate O
static O
thrust. O


NASA's O
Mercury, O
Gemini, O
and O
Apollo O
spacecraft O
experienced O
hypersonic O
flows O
as O
they O
safely O
returned O
their O
crews O
to O
the O
earth's O
surface O
during O
the O
1960's. O


Because O
the O
mission O
of O
a O
re-entering O
spacecraft O
is O
to O
slow O
from O
17500 O
mph O
to O
zero O
at O
the O
surface, O
the O
spacecraft O
is O
designed O
to O
have O
high O
drag. O


The O
bottom O
of O
the O
shuttle O
is O
covered O
with O
silicon O
tiles O
that O
insulate O
the O
aluminum O
skin O
from O
the O
heat O
of O
re-entry. O


Because O
of O
the O
high O
temperatures, O
the O
gas O
is O
an O
electrically O
charged O
plasma. O


Air-breathing O
Cruiser O


Besides O
the O
unique O
propulsion O
systems, O
these O
vehicles O
would O
likely O
include O
special O
materials O
for O
thermal O
control, O
or O
actively O
cooled O
surfaces. O


Cruising O
hypersonic O
aircraft O
would O
be O
flown O
at O
high O
dynamic O
pressure, O
or O
high-Q, O
conditions. O


Hypersonic O
flow O
experiences O
shock O
waves, O
thick O
boundary O
layers, O
and O
complex O
interactions O
between O
the O
shocks O
and O
boundary O
layers. O


Because O
of O
the O
high O
temperature B-CONCEPT
generated O
at O
Mach O
5 O
- O
7, O
real O
gas O
effects O
must O
be O
evaluated O
during O
design. O


The O
flow O
can O
be O
properly O
modeled O
by O
the O
Navier-Stokes O
equations, O
if O
provision O
is O
made O
for O
the O
real O
gas O
effects O
and O
boundary O
layer O
transition O
models. O


Air-breathing O
Accelerator O


Besides O
hypersonic O
cruise O
vehicles, O
there O
have O
been O
several O
proposed O
hypersonic O
accelerator O
vehicles. O


The O
distinction O
from O
the O
cruise O
vehicle O
is O
that O
the O
accelerator O
must O
continually O
produce O
excess O
thrust, O
thrust O
greater O
than O
drag, O
in O
order O
to O
accelerate; O
the O
accelerator O
is O
never O
flown O
in O
a O
steady O
cruise O
condition. O


Depending O
the O
exact O
mission, O
the O
accelerator O
may O
employ O
either O
TBCC O
or O
RBCC O
engines. O


The O
NASP O
design O
used O
an O
ejector O
ramjet O
for O
low O
speed B-CONCEPT
operation. O


All O
jet O
engines O
have O
an O
inlet O
to O
bring O
free O
stream O
air O
into O
the O
engine. O


The O
inlet O
sits O
upstream O
of O
the O
compressor O
and, O
while O
the O
inlet O
does O
no O
work O
on O
the O
flow, O
there O
are O
some O
important O
design O
features O
of O
the O
inlet. O


The O
total O
pressure O
pt O
through O
the O
inlet O
changes, O
however, O
because O
of O
several O
flow O
effects. O


Spec.) O


value O
of O

is O
the O
inlet O
efficiency: O


At O
supersonic O
flight O
speeds, B-CONCEPT
there O
are O
additional O
losses O
created O
by O
the O
shock O

necessary O
to O
reduce O
the O
flow O
speed B-CONCEPT
to O
subsonic O
conditions O
for O
the O
compressor. O


Mil. O


The O
amount O
of O
air O
that O
goes O
through O
the O
inlet O
is O
set O
by O
the O
engine O
and O
changes O
with O
altitude O
and O
throttle O
setting. O


Typical O
values O
of O
K O
range O
from O
0.4 O
to O
.7. O
But O
for O
a O
given O
inlet O
the O
value O
is O
determined O
experimentally. O


The O
flow O
may O
be O
swirling, O
or O
some O
section O
of O
the O
boundary O
layer O
may O
be O
thicker O
than O
another O
section O
because O
of O
the O
inlet O
shape. O


The O
rotor O
blades O
of O
the O
compressor O
move O
in O
circles O
around O
the O
central O
shaft. O


As O
the O
blades O
encounter O
distorted O
inlet O
flow, O
the O
flow O
conditions O
around O
the O
blade O
change O
very O
quickly. O


The O
changing O
flow O
conditions O
can O
cause O
flow O
separation O
in O
the O
compressor, O
a O
compressor O
stall, O
and O
can O
cause O
structural O
problems O
for O
the O
compressor O
blades. O


A O
good O
inlet O
must O
produce O
high O
pressure O
recovery, O
low O
spillage O
drag, O
and O
low O
distortion. O


Because O
an O
inlet O
is O
essentially O
a O
hollow O
tube, O
the O
weight O
considerations O
of O
the O
inlet O
are O
small O
compared O
to O
the O
compressor O
or O
turbine. O


The O
inlet O
sits O
upstream O
of O
the O
compressor O
and, O
while O
the O
inlet O
does O
no O
work O
on O
the O
flow, O
inlet O
performance O
has O
a O
strong O
influence O
on O
engine O
net O
thrust. O


As O
shown O
in O
the O
figures O
above, O
inlets O
come O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
shapes O
and O
sizes O
with O
the O
specifics O
usually O
dictated O
by O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
aircraft. O


SUBSONIC O
INLETS O


An O
inlet O
for O
a O

on O

sharp O

Other O

like O
the O

On O
the O
X-43A, O
the O
inlet O
includes O
the O
entire O
lower O
surface O
of O
the O
aircraft O
forward O
of O

At O
very O
low O
aircraft O
speeds, O
or O
when O
just O
sitting O
on O
the O
runway, O
free O
stream O
air O
is O
pulled O
into O
the O
engine O
by O
the O
compressor. O


At O
high O
speeds, O
a O
good O
inlet O
will O
allow O
the O
aircraft O
to O
maneuver O
to O
high O
angles O
of O
attack O
and O

without O
disrupting O
flow O
to O

The O

is O
characterized O
by O
a O
numerical O
inlet O

Different O
airframers O
use O
different O
indices, O
but O
all O
of O
the O

are O
based O
on O
ratios O
of O
the O

Sept O

version O
1.0a O
was O
released. O


This O
is O
the O
first O
version O
of O
this O
program. O


Thermodynamics O
deals O
only O
with O
the O
large O
scale O
response O
of O
a O
system O
which O
we O
can O
observe O
and O
measure O
in O
experiments. O


In O
aerodynamics, O
we O
are O
most O
interested O
in O
thermodynamics O
for O
the O
role O
it O
plays O
in O
engine O
design O
and O
high O
speed B-CONCEPT
flows. O


On O
this O
slide O
we O
derive O
two O
important O
equations O
which O
relate O
the O
pressure, O
temperature, B-CONCEPT
and O
volume O
which O
a O
gas O
occupies O
during O
reversible O
compression O
or O
expansion. O


Such O
a O
process O
occurs O
during O
the O
compression O
and O
power O
strokes O
for O
an O
internal O
combustion O
engine. O


The O
same O
equations O
describe O
the O
conditions O
across O
the O
compressor O
and O
turbine O
of O
a O
gas O
turbine O
engine. O


The O
motion O
of O
the O
gray O
piston O
inside O
the O
blue O
cylinder O
turns O
the O
red O
section O
of O
the O
crankshaft O
which O
turns O
the O
propellers O
to O
generate O
thrust. O


This O
change O
in O
volume O
results O
in O
a O
change O
in O
pressure O
and O
temperature B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
gas O
which O
determines O
how O
much O
work O
the O
piston O
can O
deliver. O


We O
are O
further O
going O
to O
neglect O
any O
friction O
between O
the O
piston O
and O
cylinder O
and O
assume O
that O
there O
are O
no O
energy O
losses O
of O
any O
kind. O


(In O
reality O
there O
are O
small O
losses O
and O
we O
account O
for O
the O
losses O
by O
an O
"efficiency O
factor O"
applied O
to O
the O
result O
we O
obtain O
assuming O
no O
losses.) O


We O
begin O
our O
derivation O
by O
determining O
the O
value O
of O
a O
factor O
which O
we O
will O
need O
later. O


From O
the O
definitions O
of O
the O

coefficients, O
the O

R: O


gamma B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
cp I-EQUATION
/ I-EQUATION
cv I-EQUATION


If O
we O
divide O
the O
first O
equation O
by O
cp, O
and O
use O
the O
definition O
of O
gamma O
we O
obtain: O


Then O
the O
equation O
becomes: O


cp B-EQUATION
ln(T2 I-EQUATION
/ I-EQUATION
T1) I-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
R I-EQUATION
ln(p2 I-EQUATION
/ I-EQUATION
p1) I-EQUATION


T2 B-EQUATION

= I-EQUATION
(p2 I-EQUATION

p1) I-EQUATION
^ I-EQUATION
(R I-EQUATION
/ I-EQUATION
cp) I-EQUATION


where O
the O
symbol O
^ O
denotes O
an O
exponent. O


For O
air, O
at O
standard O
conditions, O
it O
is O

The O

(1 O

is O
about O
.286. O

where O
v O
is O
the O
specific O
volume O
occupied O
by O
the O
gas. O


Multiply O
both O
sides O
by O
(p1 O
/ O
p2) O
to O
get: O


The O
quantity O
(v1 O
/ O
v2) O
is O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
volume O
at O
state O
1 O
and O
state O
2 O
and O
is O
called O
the O
compression O
ratio. O


If O
the O

of I-CONCEPT
the O
gas O
is O
much O
less O
than O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT

the O
density B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
the O
gas O
remains O
constant O
and O
the O
velocity O
of I-CONCEPT
the O
flow O
increases. O


Considering O
flow O
through O
a O
tube, O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
figure, O
if O
the O
flow O
is O
very O
gradually O
compressed O
(area O
decreases) O
and O
then O
gradually O
expanded O
(area O
increases), O
the O
flow O
conditions O
return O
to O
their O
original O
values. O


Engineers O
call O
this O
type O
of O
flow O
an O
isentropic O
flow; O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
Greek O
word O
iso O
(same) O
and O
entropy. O


Isentropic O
flows O
occur O
when O
the O
change O
in O
flow O
variables O
is O
small O
and O
gradual, O
such O
as O
the O
ideal O
flow O
through O
the O
nozzle O
shown O
above. O


We O
call O
this O
an O
isentropic O
expansion O
because O
of O
the O
area O
increase. O


If O
a O
supersonic O
flow O
is O
turned O
abruptly O
and O
the O
flow O
area O
decreases, O
shock O
waves O
are O
generated O
and O
the O
flow O
is O
irreversible. O


Derived O
flow O
variables, O
like O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound I-CONCEPT
and O
the O
isentropic O
flow O
relations O
are O
slightly O
different O
for O
a O
calorically O
imperfect O
gas O
than O
the O
conditions O
predicted O
for O
a O
calorically O
perfect O
gas O
because O
some O
of I-CONCEPT

excites O
the O
vibrational O
modes O
of I-CONCEPT
the O
diatomic O

and O

in O
the O
air. O


On O
this O
page O
we O
have O
collected O
many O
of O
the O
important O
equations O
which O
describe O
an O

That's O
why O
a O

work O
in O

a O

There O

also O
an O

the O

for O
both O

As O
an O

As O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT

the O

increases O
towards O
the O

we O
must O
consider O
compressibility O

on O
the O

The O

If O
the O

a O

typically O
less O
than O
250 O

the O
density B-CONCEPT

constant. O


But O
for O
higher O

some O
of O
the O

of O
the O

goes O
into O
compressing O
the O

and O
locally O
changing O
the O

Because O
of O
the O
importance O

this O

aerodynamicists O
have O
designated O
it O
with O
a O
special O

called O
the O
Mach O

in O
honor O
of O
Ernst O
Mach, O
a O
late O

who O
studied O

The O
Mach O

For O

At O
these O

some O

From O
Newton's O

the O

If O

a O

we O

the O

we O
have O

Considering O

it O
would O
appear O
that O
for O

we O

the O

To O
solve O

problem, O
you O
have O
to O
solve O
all O
five O
equations O
simultaneously; O
that O
is O
why O
we O
call O
this O

equations. O


An O
equation O

relates O
the O

The O
key O

is O
that O
if O
there O
is O
no O
net O
force B-CONCEPT
resulting O
from O
unbalanced O
forces B-CONCEPT
acting O
on O
an O
object O
(if O
all O
the O
external O
forces B-CONCEPT
cancel O
each O

out), O
then O
the O
object O
maintains O
a O
constant O
velocity. O


And O
if O
an O
additional O
external O

applied, O
the O

changes O
because O
of O
the O

An O
aircraft O
in O
flight O
is O
a O
particularly O
good O
example O
of O
the O
first O
law O
of O
motion. O


There O
are O
four O
major O
forces O
acting O
on O
an O
aircraft; O
lift, O
weight, O
thrust, O
and O
drag. O


Now O
if O
the O
pilot O
changes O
the O
thrust O
of O
the O
engine, O
the O
thrust O
and O
drag O
are O
no O
longer O
in O
balance. O


If O
the O
thrust O
is O
increased, O
the O
aircraft O
accelerates O
and O
the O
velocity O
increases. O


The O
drag O
of O
the O
aircraft O
depends O
on O
the O
square O
of O
the O
velocity. O


So O
the O
drag O
increases O
with O
increased O
velocity. O


Remember, O
in O
this O
simple O
example, O
that O
we O
are O
only O
considering O
the O
motion O
of O
the O
aircraft O
in O
a O
horizontal O
direction; O
we O
are O
neglecting O
any O
effects O
of O
the O
thrust O
on O
weight O
or O
on O
lift. O


On O
real O
aircraft, O
increasing O
the O
throttle O
setting O
increases O
the O
fuel O
usage O
and O
decreases O
the O
weight, O
and O
the O
increase O
in O
velocity O
increases O
the O
lift O
as O
well O
as O
the O
drag. O


Each O
of O
these O
changes O
affect O
the O
vertical O
motion O
of O
the O
aircraft, O
but O
to O
simplify O
our O
understanding O
of O
Newton's O
laws, O
we O
are O
neglecting O
these O
effects O
in O
this O
example. O


It's O
important O
to O
point O
out O
the O
role O
of O
engine O
thrust O
in O
this O
example. O


The O
motion O
of O
an O
aircraft O
through O
the O
air O
can O
be O
explained O
and O
described O
by O
physical O
principals O
discovered O
over O
300 O
years O
ago O
by O
Sir O
Isaac O
Newton. O


He O
developed O
the O
theories O
of O
gravitation O
in O
1666, O
when O
he O
was O
only O
23 O
years O
old. O


Some O
twenty O
years O
later, O
in O
1686, O
he O
presented O
his O
three O
laws O
of O
motion O
in O
the O
"Principia O
Mathematica O
Philosophiae O
Naturalis. O"


The O
laws O
are O
shown O
above, O
and O
the O
application O
of O
these O
laws O
to O
aerodynamics O
are O
given O
on O
separate O
slides. O


If O
that O
velocity O
is O
zero, O
then O
the O
object O
remains O
at O
rest. O


The O
law O
defines O
a O
force B-CONCEPT
to O
be O
equal O
to O
change O
in O
momentum B-CONCEPT
(B-CONCEPT_mass O
times B-CONCEPT
velocity) O
per O
change O
in O
time. B-CONCEPT


For O
an O
object O
with O
a O
constant O
mass B-CONCEPT
m, O
the O
second O
law O
states O
that O
the O
force B-CONCEPT
F O
is O
the O
product O
of O
an O
object's O
mass B-CONCEPT
and O
its O
acceleration B-CONCEPT
a: O


For O
an O
external O
applied O
force, B-CONCEPT
the O
change O
in O
velocity O
depends O
on O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
object. O


The O
equation O
works O
both O
ways. O


The O
third O
law O
states O
that O
for O
every O
action O
(B-CONCEPT_force) O
in O
nature O
there O
is O
an O
equal O
and O
opposite O
reaction. O


The O
momentum B-CONCEPT
is O
defined O
to O
be O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
of O
an O
object O
m O
times O
its O
velocity O
v. O
So O
the O
differential O
equation O
for O
force B-CONCEPT
F O
is: O


If O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
is O
a O
constant O
and O
using O
the O
definition O
of O
acceleration B-CONCEPT
a O
as O
the O
change O
in O
velocity O
with O
time, B-CONCEPT
the O
second O
law O
reduces O
to O
the O
more O
familiar O
product O
of O
a O
mass B-CONCEPT
and O
an O
acceleration: B-CONCEPT


Since O
acceleration B-CONCEPT
is O
a O
change O
in O
velocity O
with O
a O
change O
in O
time B-CONCEPT
t, O
we O
can O
also O
write O
this O
equation O
in O
the O
third O
form O
shown O
on O
the O
slide: O


The O
important O
fact O
is O
that O
a O
force B-CONCEPT
will O
cause O
a O
change O
in O
velocity; O
and O
likewise, O
a O
change O
in O
velocity O
will O
generate O
a O
force. B-CONCEPT


The O
equations O
shown O
here O
are O
actually O
vector O
equations O
and O
can O
be O
applied O
in O
each O
of O
the O
component O
directions. O


In O
other O
words, O
if O
object O
A O
exerts O
a O
force B-CONCEPT
on O
object O
B, O
then O
object O
B O
also O
exerts O
an O
equal O
and O
opposite O
force B-CONCEPT
on O
object O
A. O
Notice O
that O
the O
forces B-CONCEPT
are O
exerted O
on O
different O
objects. O


In O
this O
problem, O
the O
air O
is O
deflected O
downward O
by O
the O
action O
of O
the O
airfoil, O
and O
in O
reaction O
the O
wing O
is O
pushed O
upward. O


The O
engine O
produces O
hot O
exhaust O
gases O
which O
flow O
out O
the O
back O
of O
the O
engine. O


In O
reaction, O
a O
thrusting O
force B-CONCEPT
is O
produced O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction. O


As O
an O
object O
moves O
through O
a O
gas, O
the O
gas O
molecules O
are O
deflected O
around O
the O
object. O


As O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
the O
object O
increases O
towards O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound, I-CONCEPT
we O
must O
consider O
compressibility O
effects O
on O
the O
gas. O


For O
compressible O
flows O
with O
little O
or O
small O
flow O
turning, O
the O
flow O
process O
is O
reversible O
and O
the O
entropy O
is O
constant. O


The O
change O
in O
flow O
properties O
are O
then O
given O
by O
the O
isentropic O

(isentropic O
means O
"constant O

The O
Mach O

of O
the O

decrease O
across O
a O

But O
under O
low O

or O
high O

the O

The O

Using O

With O

we O

You O
can O
explore O
the O
design O
and O

of O
turbojet O
and O
rocket O
nozzles O
with O
our O
interactive O
nozzle O
simulator O
program O
which O
runs O
on O
your O
browser. O


A O
nozzle O
is O
a O
relatively O
simple O
device, O
just O
a O
specially O
shaped O
tube O
through O
which O
hot O
gases O
flow. O


As O
shown O
above, O
nozzles O
come O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
shapes O
and O
sizes O
depending O
on O
the O
mission O
of O
the O
aircraft. O


Simple O
turbojets, O
and O
turboprops, O
often O
have O
a O
fixed O
geometry O
convergent O
nozzle O
as O
shown O
on O
the O
left O
of O
the O
figure. O


Mixing O
of O
the O
two O
flows O
provides O
some O
thrust O
enhancement O
and O
these O
nozzles O
also O
tend O
to O
be O
quieter O
than O
convergent O
nozzles. O


All O
of O
the O
nozzles O
we O
have O
discussed O
thus O
far O
are O
round O
tubes. O


The O
internal O
nozzle O
is O
usually O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
engine O
manufacturer. O


If O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
the O
object O
is O
much O
less O
than O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound I-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
the O
gas, O
the O
density B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
the O
gas O
remains O
constant O
and O
the O
flow O
of I-CONCEPT
gas O
can O
be O
described O
by O
conserving O
momentum, B-CONCEPT
and O
energy. O


As O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
the O
object O
approaches O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound, I-CONCEPT
we O
must O
consider O
compressibility O
effects O
on O
the O
gas. O


For O
compressible O
flows O
with O
little O
or O
small O
flow O
turning, O
the O
flow O
process O
is O
reversible O
and O
the O
entropy O
is O
constant. O


The O
change O
in O
flow O
properties O
are O
then O
given O
by O
the O
isentropic O
relations O
(isentropic O
means O
"constant O
entropy). O"


But O
when O
an O
object O
moves O
faster O
than O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of I-CONCEPT
sound, I-CONCEPT
and O
there O
is O
an O
abrupt O
decrease O
in O
the O
flow O
area, O
shock O
waves O
are O
generated O
in O
the O
flow. O


Shock O
waves O
are O
very O
small O
regions O
in O
the O
gas O
where O
the O
gas O
properties O
change O
by O
a O
large O
amount. O


Across O
a O
shock O
wave, O
the O
static O
pressure, O
temperature, B-CONCEPT
and O
gas O
density B-CONCEPT
increases O
almost O
instantaneously. O


But O
because O
the O
flow O
is O
non-isentropic, O
the O
total O
pressure O
downstream O
of O
the O
shock O
is O
always O
less O
than O
the O
total O
pressure O
upstream O
of O
the O
shock; O
there O
is O
a O
loss O
of O
total O
pressure O
associated O
with O
a O
shock O
wave. O


The O
ratio O
of O
the O
total O
pressure O
is O
shown O
on O
the O
slide. O


Because O
total O
pressure O
changes O
across O
the O
shock, O
we O
can O
not O
use O
the O
usual O
(incompressible) O
form O
of O
Bernoulli's O
equation O
across O
the O
shock. O


The O
Mach O
number O
and O
speed B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
flow O
also O
decrease O
across O
a O
shock O
wave. O


If O
the O
shock O
wave O
is O
inclined O
to O
the O
flow O
direction O
it O
is O
called O
an O
oblique O
shock. O


The O
equations O
presented O
here O
were O
derived O
by O
considering O
the O
conservation O
of O
mass, B-CONCEPT
momentum, B-CONCEPT
and O
energy O
for O
a O
compressible O
gas O
while O
ignoring O
viscous O
effects. O


The O
equations O
have O
been O
further O
specialized O
for O
a O
two-dimensional O
flow O
(not O
three O
dimensional O
axisymmetric) O
without O
heat O
addition. O


The O
equations O
only O
apply O
for O
those O
combinations O
of O
free O
stream O
Mach O
number O
and O
wedge O
angle O
for O
which O
an O
attached O
oblique O
shock O
occurs. O


If O
the O
Mach O
number O
is O
too O
low, O
or O
the O
wedge O
angle O
too O
high, O
the O
normal O
shock O
equations O
should O
be O
used. O

some O

The O
word O
hypotenuse O
comes O
from O
two O
Greek O
words O
meaning O
"to O
stretch, O"
since O
this O
is O
the O
longest O
side. O


A B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
a I-EQUATION

So O
the O
Pythagorean O
theorem O
states O
the O
area O
h^2 O
of O
the O
square O
drawn O
on O
the O
hypotenuse O
is O
equal O
to O
the O

drawn O
on O
side O
a O
plus O
the O
area O
b^2 O
of O
the O
square O
drawn O
on O

We O
begin O
with O
a O
right O
triangle O
on O
which O
we O
have O
constructed O
squares O
on O
the O
two O
sides, O
one O
red O
and O
one O

We O
are O
going O
to O
break O
up O
the O
pieces O
of O
these O
two O
squares O
and O
move O
them O
into O
the O
grey O
square O
area O
on O
the O
hypotenuse. O


We O
won't O
loose O
any O

during O

operation. O


You O

You O
can O

What O
is O
it O
doing? O


Using O
the O
terminology O
from O
the O
figure O
at O
the O
top O
of O
this O
page, O
the O
dimensions O
of O
the O
red O

are: O


vertical O

The O
next O
step O
is O
to O
move O
the O
other O
blue O
triangle O
into O
the O
hypotenuse O
square. O


(We O
are O
half O
way O
there!) O
The O
next O
step O
is O
to O
slide O
the O
form O
of O
the O
original O
triangle O
to O
the O
left O
into O
the O
red O

The O
triangle O
cuts O
the O
red O
region O
into O
three O
pieces, O
two O

and O
a O

The O

= I-EQUATION
a I-EQUATION
+ I-EQUATION
(b I-EQUATION

= I-EQUATION
b I-EQUATION


Again O
it's O
a O
perfect O
fit. O


Now O
if O
we O
look O
at O
the O
grey O
square O
that O
remains O
in O
the O
hypotenuse O
square, O
we O
see O
that O
its O
dimensions O
are O

a; O
the O
long O

of O
the O

minus O
the O

It's O
a O

and O
we O
have O
used O
all O
the O

from O
the O
original O
red O

A O
ramjet O
uses O
the O
forward O
speed B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
aircraft O
to O
compress O
the O
incoming O
air O
and, O
therefore, O
has O
fewer O
moving O
parts O
than O
a O
turbine O
engine. O


In O
the O
computer O
drawing, O
we O
have O
cut O
out O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
engine O
to O
have O
a O
look O
inside. O


At O
the O
front O
of O
the O
engine, O
to O
the O
left, O
is O
the O
inlet, O
which O
brings O
outside O
air O
into O
the O
engine. O


At O
the O
exit O
of O
the O
inlet, O
the O
air O
is O
at O
a O
much O
higher O
pressure O
than O
free O

conditions. O


The O
resulting O

is O
stabilized O
in O
the O
engine O
by O
the O
red O

ring. O


To O
analyze O
ramjet O
operation, O
engineers O
have O
adopted O
a O
numbering O

for O
the O
various O
parts. O


You O
can O
vary O
the O
performance O
of O
any O
of O
the O
engine O

and O
investigate O
the O
effects O
on O
thrust O

On O

the O

Different O
propulsion O
systems O
develop O
thrust O
in O
different O
ways, O
but O
all O
thrust O
is O
generated O
through O
some O
application O
of O
Newton's O
third O

of O
motion. O


To O
maintain O
the O
flow O
through O
the O

the O
combustion O
must O
occur O
at O
a O
pressure O
that O
is O
higher O
than O
the O

at O
the O
nozzle O

Ramjets O
produce O
thrust O
only O
when O
the O

is O
already O
moving; O
ramjets O
cannot O
produce O
thrust O
when O
the O

The O
higher O

the O

a O

until O
aerodynamic O

The O

solves O
this O

by O

the O

A O

provides O
a O

Unlike O
a O

ramjets O

have O
no O

only O
an O

a O

that O
consists O
of O
a O

The O

a O

To O

it O
is O
necessary O
to O
use O
some O

Using O

Because O

the O

To O
better O
understand O
the O
science O
of O
propulsion O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
use O
some O
mathematical O
ideas O
from O
vector O
analysis. O


Most O
people O
are O
introduced O
to O
vectors O
in O
high O
school O
or O
college, O
but O
for O
the O
elementary O
and O
middle O
school O
students, O
or O
the O
mathematically-challenged: O


Vectors O
allow O
us O
to O
look O
at O
complex, O
multi-dimensional O
problems O
as O
a O
simpler O
group O
of O
one-dimensional O
problems. O


We O
observe O
that O
there O
are O
some O
quantities O
and O
processes O
in O
our O
world O
that O
depend O
on O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
they O
occur, O
and O
there O
are O
some O
quantities O
that O
do O
not O
depend O
on O
direction. O


For O
example, O
the O
volume O
of O
an O
object, O
the O
three-dimensional O
space O
that O
an O
object O
occupies, O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
direction. O


If O
we O
have O
a O
5 O
cubic O
foot O
block O
of O
iron O
and O
we O
move O
it O
up O
and O
down O
and O
then O
left O
and O
right, O
we O
still O
have O
a O
5 O
cubic O
foot O
block O
of O
iron. O


On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
location, O
of O
an O
object O
does O
depend O
on O
direction. O


If O
we O
move O
the O
5 O
cubic O
foot O
block O
5 O
miles O
to O
the O
north, O
the O
resulting O
location O
is O
very O
different O
than O
if O
we O
moved O
it O
5 O
miles O
to O
the O
east. O


Vector O
quantities O
have O
two O
characteristics, O
a O
magnitude O
and O
a O
direction. O


When O
comparing O
two O
vector O
quantities O
of O
the O
same O
type, O
you O
have O
to O
compare O
both O
the O
magnitude O
and O
the O
direction. O


When O
doing O
any O
mathematical O
operation O
on O
a O
vector O
quantity O
(like O
adding, O
subtracting, O
multiplying O
..) O


you O
have O
to O
consider O
both O
the O
magnitude O
and O
the O
direction. O


These O
quantities O
can O
be O
determined O
by O
application O
of O
Newton's O
laws O
for O
vectors. O


The O
scalar O
quantities O
include O
most O
of O
the O
thermodynamic O
state O
variables O
involved O
with O
the O
propulsion O
system, O
such O
as O
the O
density, B-CONCEPT
pressure, O
and O
temperature B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
propellants. O


There O
are O
some O
quantities, O
like O
speed, B-CONCEPT
which O
have O
very O
special O
definitions O
for O
scientists. O


By O
definition, O
speed B-CONCEPT
is O
the O
scalar O
magnitude O
of O
a O
velocity O
vector. O


While O
Newton's O
laws O
describe O
the O
resulting O
motion O
of O
a O
solid, O
there O
are O
special O
equations O

For O
any O
physical O
system, O
the O
mass, B-CONCEPT
momentum, B-CONCEPT
and O
energy O

must O
be O
conserved. O


This O
results O
in O
a O
coupled O
set O
of O
equations, O
called O
the O
Navier-Stokes O
equations, O
which O
describe O
how O
fluids O
behave O
when O
subjected O
to O
external O
forces. O


Thrust O
is O
produced O
by O
passing O
the O
hot O
exhaust O
from O
the O
combustion O
of O
a O
fuel O
through O
a O
nozzle. O


The O
external O
air O
that O
is O
brought O
into O
the O
propulsion O
system O
becomes O
the O
working O
fluid, O
much O
like O
a O
turbojet O
engine. O


In O
the O
1960's O
an O
improved O
ramjet O
was O
proposed O
in O
which O
the O
combustion O
in O
the O
burner O
would O
occur O
supersonically. O


Tests O
were O
begun O
to O
design O
the O
supersonic O
burner O
and O
to O
better O
integrate O
the O
inlet O
and O
nozzle O
with O
the O
airframe. O

with O
the O
large O
scale O

of O
a O
system O
which O
we O

Entropy O
has O
a O
variety O
of O
physical O
interpretations, O
including O
the O
statistical O

of O
the O

but O
for O
our O

let O
us O
consider O
entropy O
to O
be O
just O
another O
property O
of O
the O
system, O
like O
enthalpy B-CONCEPT

The O

on O
the O

To O
make O
things O
more O
confusing, O
the O

and O
create O
an O

A O
90 O
degree O
angle O
is O
called O
a O
right O
angle O
which O
gives O
the O
right O
triangle O
its O
name. O


If O
we O
know O
the O
value O
of O
c, O
we O
then O
know O
that O
the O
value O
of O
d: O


90 B-EQUATION
+ I-EQUATION
c I-EQUATION
+ I-EQUATION
d I-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
180 I-EQUATION


We O
define O
the O
side O
of O
the O
triangle O
opposite O
from O
the O
right O
angle O
to O
be O
the O
hypotenuse. O


It O
is O
the O
longest O
side O
of O
the O
three O
sides O
of O
the O
right O
triangle. O


The O
remaining O
side O
we O
label O
a O
for O
adjacent. O


Let O
us O
start O
with O
some O
definitions. O


tan B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
o I-EQUATION
/ I-EQUATION
a I-EQUATION


To O
demonstrate O
this O
fact, O
let's O
study O
the O
three O
figures O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
page. O


In O
this O
example, O
we O
have O
an O
8 O
foot O
ladder O
that O
we O
are O
going O
to O
lean O
against O
a O
wall. O


The O
wall O
is O
8 O
feet O
high, O
and O
we O
have O
drawn O
white O
lines O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
blue O
lines O
along O
the O
ground O
at O
one O
foot O
intervals. O


The O
length B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
ladder O
is O
fixed. O


The O
ladder, O
ground, O
and O
wall O
form O
a O
right O
triangle. O


The O
ratio O
of O
the O
distance O
from O
the O
wall O
(a O
- O
adjacent), O
to O
the O
length B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
ladder O
(h O
- O
hypotenuse), O
is O
43504 O
= O
.25. O


(On O
another O
page O
we O
will O
show O
that O
if O
the O
ladder O
was O
twice O
as O
long O
(16 O
feet), O
and O
inclined O
at O
the O
same O
angle(75.5 O
degrees), O
that O
it O
would O
sit O
twice O
as O
far O
(4 O
feet) O
from O
the O
wall. O


You O
can O
check O
this O
distance O
by O
using O
the O
Pythagorean O
Theorem O
that O
relates O
the O
sides O
of O
a O
right O
triangle: O


o^2 B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
8^2 I-EQUATION
- I-EQUATION
2^2 I-EQUATION


The O
ratio O
of O
the O
opposite O
to O
the O
hypotenuse O
is O
0.967 O
and O
defined O
to O
be O
the O
sine O
of O
the O
angle O
c B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
75.5 I-EQUATION
degrees. O


As O
shown O
on O
the O
figure, O
the O
ladder O
is O
now O
inclined O
at O
a O
lower O
angle O
than O
in O
the O
first O
example. O


The O
angle O
is O
60 O
degrees, O
and O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
adjacent O
to O
the O
hypotenuse O
is O
now O
43563 O
= O
0.5 O
. O


Decreasing O
the O
angle O
c O
increases O
the O
cosine O
of O
the O
angle O
because O
the O
hypotenuse O
is O
fixed O
and O
the O
adjacent O
increases O
as O
the O
angle O
decreases. O


Mathematicians O
call O
this O
situation O
a O
function. O


If O
we O
incline O
the O
ladder O
so O
that O
the O
base O
is O
6.938 O
feet O
from O
the O
wall, O
the O
angle O
c O
becomes O
30 O
degrees O
and O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
adjacent O
to O
the O
hypotenuse O
is O
.866. O


sin(c B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
60 I-EQUATION
degrees) I-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
cos I-EQUATION
(c I-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
30 I-EQUATION
degrees) I-EQUATION


Since O
the O
sine, O
cosine, O
and O
tangent O
are O
all O
functions O
of O
the O
angle O
c, O
we O
can O
determine O
(measure) O
the O
ratios O
once O
and O
produce O
tables O
of O
the O
values O
of O
the O
sine, O
cosine, O
and O
tangent O
for O
various O
values O
of O
c. O
Later, O
if O
we O
know O
the O
value O
of O
an O
angle O
in O
a O
right O
triangle, O
the O
tables O
will O
tell O
us O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
triangle. O


Some O
examples O
of O
problems O
involving O
triangles O
and O
angles O
include O
the O
forces O
on O
an O
aircraft O
in O
flight, O
the O
application O
of O
torques, O
and O
the O
resolution O
of O
the O
components O
of O
a O
vector. O


The O
smallest O
cross-sectional O
area O
of O
the O
nozzle O
is O
called O
the O
throat O
of O
the O
nozzle. O


The O
hot O
exhaust O
flow O
is O
choked O
at O
the O
throat, O
which O
means O
that O
the O
Mach O
number O
is O
equal O
to O
1 O
in O
the O
throat O
and O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
flow O
rate O
m O
dot O
is O
determined O
by O
the O
throat O
area. O


The O
area O
ratio O
from O
the O
throat O
to O
the O
exit O
Ae O
sets O
the O
exit O
velocity O
Ve O
and O
the O
exit O
pressure O
pe. O


If O
the O
free O
stream O
pressure O
is O
given O
by O
p0, O
the O
thrust O
F O
equation O
becomes: O


F B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
m I-EQUATION
dot I-EQUATION
* I-EQUATION
Ve I-EQUATION
+ I-EQUATION
(pe I-EQUATION
- I-EQUATION

* I-EQUATION
Ae I-EQUATION


Notice O
that O
there O
is O
no O
free O
stream O
mass B-CONCEPT
times O

velocity O
term O
in O
the O
thrust O

because O
no O

brought O
on O

Since O
the O
oxidizer O
is O
mixed O
into O
the O
propellant, O
solid O
rockets O
can O
generate O
thrust O
in O
a O
vacuum O
where O
there O
is O
no O

source O
of O
oxygen. O


The O
thrust O

works O
for O
both O
liquid O
and O
solid O

engines. O


The O

The O

Strong O

on O
the O

The O
only O
manned O

to O
currently O
fly O
in O
this O
regime O
are O
the O
American O
Space O

the O
Russian O

The O
figure O
shows O
the O
Shuttle O
after O
it O
has O
passed O
through O
the O
re-entry O
regime. O


The O
Shuttle O
uses O
a O
rocket O
propulsion O
system O
to O
get O
into O
orbit, O
but O
during O
re-entry O
the O
aircraft O
is O
actually O
an O
un-powered O
glider. O


Small O
steering O
rockets O
are O
used O
for O
maneuvering O
early O
in O
the O
re-entry O
because O
the O
low O
density B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
air O
at O
altitudes O
above O
50 O
miles O
makes O
aerodynamic O
surfaces O
ineffective. O


On O
the O

the O

Thermodynamics O
is O
a O
branch O
of O
physics O
which O
deals O
with O
the O
energy O
and O
work O
of O
a O
system. O


We O
are O
going O
to O
be O
using O
specific O
values O
of O
the O

variables. O


This O
allows O
us O
to O
derive O
relations O
between O
variables O
without O
regard O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
substance O
that O
we O
have. O


We O
can O
multiply O
the O
specific O

by O
the O
quantity O
of O
the O

at O
any O
time B-CONCEPT
to O
determine O
the O
actual O

of O
the O

The O

is O
a O

The O

From O
the O

The O

are O
all O

We O

We O
will O
discuss O
the O
details O
of O
various O
propulsion O
systems O
on O
some O
other O
pages. O


For O
right O
now, O
let O
us O
just O
think O
of O
the O
propulsion O
system O
as O
some O
machine O
which O
accelerates O
a O
gas. O


When O
dealing O
with O
a O
gas, O
the O
basic O
thrust O
equation O
is O
given O
as: O


F B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION

* I-EQUATION
Ve I-EQUATION
+ I-EQUATION
(pe I-EQUATION
- I-EQUATION
p0) I-EQUATION

Using O
algebra, O
let O
us O
divide O
by O
mdot: O


F B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
mdot I-EQUATION
* I-EQUATION
Veq I-EQUATION


The O
total O
impulse O
(I) O
of O
a O
rocket O
is O
defined O
as O
the O
average O
thrust O
times B-CONCEPT
the O
total O
time B-CONCEPT
of O
firing. O


On O
the O
slide O
we O
show O
the O
total O
time B-CONCEPT
as O
"delta O
t. O"


I B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
F I-EQUATION
* I-EQUATION
delta I-EQUATION
t I-EQUATION


Since O
the O
thrust O
may O
change O
with O
time, B-CONCEPT
we O
can O
also O
define O
an O
integral O
equation O
for O
the O
total O
impulse. O


Using O
the O
symbol O
(Sdt) O
for O
the O
integral, O
we O
have: O


I B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
S I-EQUATION
F I-EQUATION
dt I-EQUATION


Substituting O
the O
equation O
for O
thrust O
given O
above: O


I B-EQUATION
= I-EQUATION
S I-EQUATION
(mdot I-EQUATION
* I-EQUATION

where O
g0 O
is O
the O
gravitational O
acceleration B-CONCEPT
constant O
(32.2 O

in O
English O
units, O
9.8 O

units). O


Second, O
it O
is O
an O
indication O
of O
engine O
efficiency. O


The O
engine O
with O
the O
higher O
value O
of O
specific B-CONCEPT
impulse I-CONCEPT
is O
more O
efficient O
because O
it O
produces O
more O
thrust O
for O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
propellant. O


Third, O
it O
simplifies O
our O
mathematical O
analysis O
of O
rocket O
thermodynamics. O


Fourth, O
it O
gives O
us O
an O
easy O
way O
to O
size O
an O
engine O
during O
preliminary O
analysis. O


This O
information O
determines O
the O
physical O
size O
of O
the O
engine. O


There O
is O
a O
similar O
efficiency O
parameter O
called O
the O
specific O
thrust O
which O
is O
used O
to O
characterize O
turbine O
engine O
performance. O


The O
state O
of O
a O
gas O
is O
defined O
by O
various O
properties O
which O
we O
can O
observe O
with O
our O
senses, O
including O
the O
gas O
pressure O
(p), O
temperature B-CONCEPT
(T), O
mass B-CONCEPT
(number O
of O
moles O
- O
m), O
and O
volume O
(V) O
which O
contains O
the O
gas. O


For O
example, O
suppose O
we O
have O
a O
tank O
of O
gas. O


The O
value O
of O
pressure O
and O
temperature B-CONCEPT
does O
not O
depend O
on O
the O
amount O
of O
gas O
used O
in O
the O
measurement. O


Cutting O
the O
volume O
in O
two O
cuts O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
in O
two. O


The O
mass B-CONCEPT
depends O
on O
the O
volume O
and, O
in O
turn, O
the O
volume O
depends O
on O
the O
mass. B-CONCEPT


When O
performing O
a O
thermodynamic O
analysis, O
it O
is O
much O
easier O
to O
deal O
with O
only O
intensive O
properties O
since O
we O
are O
able O
to O
eliminate O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
from O
the O
analysis. O


Since O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
and O
volume O
are O
directly O
related O
to O
each O
other O
under O
static O
conditions, O
we O
can O
define O
a O
new O
property O
called O
the O
specific O
volume O
which O
is O
equal O
to O
the O
volume O
divided O
by O
the O
mass. B-CONCEPT


Specific O
volume O
is O
an O
intensive O
property O
of O
the O
gas, O
as O
shown O
in O
our O
example. O


The O
specific O
of O
specific O
volume O
simply O
means O
"divided O
by O
mass. B-CONCEPT"


The O
speed B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
object O
relative O
to O
the O
gas O
introduces O
many O
significant O
effects. O


In O
our O
discussions, O
we O
will O
use O
the O
Mach O
number O
of O
the O
object O
and O
the O
Mach O
number O
of O
the O
flow O
interchangeably. O


If O
we O
travel O
with O
the O
object O
as O
it O
moves O
through O
the O
air, O
the O
air O
moves O
past O
the O
object O
at O
the O
speed B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
object. O


For O
a O
moving O
flow O
of O
gas, O
there O
are O
several O
different O
values O
for O
the O
temperature B-CONCEPT
of O
the O
gas. O


From O
kinetic O
theory, O
static O
temperature B-CONCEPT
is O
related O
to O
the O
average O
kinetic O
energy O
of O
the O
random O
motion O
of O
the O
molecules O
of O
the O
gas. O


The O
solid O
line O
is O
the O
computed O
stagnation O
temperature B-CONCEPT
for O
a O
calorically O
perfect O
gas O
and O
the O
dashed O
line O
is O
the O
computed O
stagnation O
temperature B-CONCEPT
for O
a O
calorically O
imperfect O
gas. O


But O
beginning O
around O
Mach O
3, O
real O

become O
increasingly O
important O
with O
increasing O
Mach O
number. O

To O
describe O
a O
triangle O
in O
general, O
we O
need O
to O
know O
the O
value O
of O
two O
angles; O
for O
a O
right O
triangle O
we O
only O
need O
to O
know O
(or O
measure) O
one O
angle. O


We O
call O
the O
side O
of O
the O
right O
triangle O
opposite O
from O
the O
right O
angle O
the O
hypotenuse. O


We O
will O
label O
the O
hypotenuse O
with O
the O
symbol O
h O
and O
we O
will O
label O
the O
other O
two O
sides O
a O

The O
value O
of O

is O
a O
function O
of O

is O

The O
key O
point O
here O
is O
that O
if O
we O
measure O
one O
angle, O
we O
know O
the O
value O
of O
all O
three O
angles O
in O
a O

And O
if O
we O
additionally O
measure O
one O
side, O
we O
can O
use O
these O
trigonometric O
functions O
to O
determine O
the O
length B-CONCEPT

all O

We O
can O
determine O
5 O
pieces O

(2 O

by O
making O
only O
two O
measurements. O


The O
first O
and O
simplest O
type O
of O
gas O
turbine O
is O
the O
turbojet. O


On O
this O
slide O
we O
show O
a O
schematic O

of O
a O

engine. O


Here, O
we O
are O
concerned O
with O
what O
happens O
to O
the O
air O
that O
passes O
through O
the O
engine. O


We O
have O
shown O
here O
a O
tube-shaped O
inlet, O
like O
one O
you O
would O
see O
on O
an O
airliner. O


A O
compressor O
is O
like O
an O
electric O
fan O
and O
we O
have O
to O
supply O
energy O
to O
turn O
the O
compressor. O


At O
the O
exit O
of O
the O
compressor, O
the O
air O
is O
at O
a O
much O
higher O
pressure O
than O

In O
a O
typical O

engine, O
100 O
pounds O
of O

is O
combined O
with O
only O
2 O

Most O
of O
the O

has O
come O
from O
the O
surrounding O

Leaving O
the O
burner, O
the O
hot O
exhaust O
is O
passed O
through O
the O
turbine. O


In O
a O
jet O
engine O
we O
use O
the O

extracted O
by O
the O

to O

the O

by O

the O

by O

some O

they O

and O
there O
are O
some O

A O
quantity O
which O
does O
not O
depend O
on O

is O
called O
a O
scalar O
quantity. O


When O
comparing O
two O
vector O
quantities O
of O
the O

type, O
you O
have O
to O
compare O
both O
the O
magnitude O

Vector O

Note: O
The O

You O

So, O
you O
have O

The O

From O
the O

the O

the O

the O

because O

Now O
since O

we O

In O

We O

Vector O

We O

Similarly, O

We O

The O

We O

On O

we O
list O
some O
equations O
for O
computing O
the O
volume O
of O
objects O
which O
often O
occur O
in O
aerospace. O


The O
magnitude O

the O

on O
the O

an O

while O
the O

certain O

the O

A O
simple O

on O
any O
formula O

area O

is O
a O

Area O
is O

an O

dimensions O

for O

Volume O
is O
the O
three-dimensional O

that O
an O

Since O
the O

A O

It O
was O
born O
in O
the O
19th O
century O
as O
scientists O
were O
first O
discovering O
how O
to O
build O
and O
operate O
steam O
engines. O


The O
methods O
compliment O
each O
other; O
some O
principles O
are O
more O
easily O
understood O
in O
terms O
of O
thermodynamics O
and O
some O
principles O
are O
more O
easily O
explained O
by O
kinetic O

The O
zeroth O
law O
of O
thermodynamics O
involves O
some O
simple O
definitions O
of O
thermodynamic O
equilibrium. O


This O
law O
is O
sometimes O
taken O
as O
the O
definition O
of O
internal O
energy, O
and O
introduces O
an O
additional O
state O
variable, O
enthalpy. B-CONCEPT


But O
experience O
indicates O
that O
only O
certain O
states O
occur. O


This O
leads O
to O
the O
second O
law O
of O
thermodynamics O
and O
the O
definition O
of O
another O
state O
variable O
called O
entropy. O


The O
state O
of O
a O
gas O
is O
determined O
by O
the O
values O
of O
certain O
measurable O
properties O
like O
the O
pressure, O
temperature, B-CONCEPT
and O
volume O
which O
the O
gas O
occupies. O


On O
the O
figure, O
we O
use O
physical O
volume. O


For O
a O
gas, O
work O
is O
the O
product O
of O
the O
pressure O

and O
the O

V O
during O
a O

In O
general, O
during O
a O
change O
of O
state O
both O
the O
volume O
and O
the O
pressure O
change. O


So O
it O
is O
more O
correct O
to O
define O
the O
work O
as O
the O
integrated, O
or O
summed O
variable O
pressure O
times O
the O
change O
of O
volume O
from O
State O
1 O
to O
State O
2 O
If O
we O
use O
the O
symbol O
S O
[ O
] O
ds O
for O
integral, O
then: O


As O
mentioned O
above, O
there O
are O
several O
options O
for O
changing O
the O
state O
of O
a O
gas O
from O
one O
state O
to O
another. O


So O
we O
might O
expect O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
work O
done O
on, O
or O
by O
a O
gas O
could O
be O
different O
depending O
on O
exactly O
how O
the O
state O
is O
changed. O


As O
an O
example, O
on O
the O
graph O
on O
the O
figure, O
we O
show O
a O
curved O
black O
line O
from O
State O
1 O
to O
State O
2 O
of O
our O
confined O
gas. O


State O
a O
is O
at O
the O
same O
pressure O
as O
State O
1, O
but O
at O
a O
different O
volume. O


The O
work O
done O
by O
a O
gas O
not O
only O
depends O
on O
the O
initial O
and O
final O
states O
of O
the O
gas O
but O
also O
on O
the O
process O
used O
to O
change O
the O
state. O


Notice O
that O
not O
only O
does O
the O
work O
done O
by O
the O
gas O
depend O
on O
the O
process, O
but O
also O
the O
heat O
transferred O
to O
the O
gas. O


Thermodynamics O
deals O
only O
with O
the O
large O
scale O
response O
of O
a O
system O
which O
we O
can O
observe O
and O
measure O
in O
experiments. O


We O
all O
have O
a O
basic O
understanding O
of O
work O
in O
general, O
but O
scientists O
have O
a O
more O
precise O
definition O
of O
work. O


As O
an O
example O
shown O
on O
the O
slide, O
an O
aircraft O
which O
is O
acted O
on O
by O
a O
force B-CONCEPT
F O
from O
time B-CONCEPT
equals O
zero O
to O
some O
later O
time B-CONCEPT
t O
moves O
some O
distance O
s. O
The O
work O
W O
done O
on O
the O
aircraft O
during O
this O
time B-CONCEPT
is: O


In O
our O
simple O
example, O
the O
force B-CONCEPT
is O
a O
constant O
value O
aligned O
with O
the O
displacement O
of O
the O
aircraft. O


W B-EQUATION

The O
force B-CONCEPT
is O
a O
vector O
quantity O
which O
changes O
in O
both O
magnitude O
and O
direction. O


Using O
a O
cruising O
aircraft O
as O
another O
example, O
the O
lift O
is O
defined O
to O
be O
the O
force B-CONCEPT
perpendicular O
to O
the O
flight O
path. O


Each O
law O
leads O
to O
the O
definition O
of O
thermodynamic O
properties O
which O
help O
us O
to O
understand O
and O
predict O
the O
operation O
of O
a O
physical O
system. O


Fortunately, O
many O
of O
the O
classical O
examples O
involve O
gas O
dynamics. O


Unfortunately, O
the O
numbering O
system O
for O
the O
three O
laws O
of O
thermodynamics O
is O
a O
bit O
confusing. O


We O
begin O
with O
the O
zeroth O
law. O


But, O
eventually, O
the O
change O
in O
property O
stops O
and O
the O
objects O
are O
said O
to O
be O
in O
thermal, O
or O
thermodynamic, O
equilibrium. O


When O
two O
objects O
are O
in O
thermal B-CONCEPT
equilibrium I-CONCEPT
they O
are O
said O
to O
have O
the O
same O
temperature. B-CONCEPT


During O
the O
process O
of O
reaching O
thermal B-CONCEPT
equilibrium, I-CONCEPT
heat, O
which O
is O
a O
form O
of O
energy, O
is O
transferred O
between O
the O
objects. O


When O
two O
objects O
are O
separately O
in O
thermodynamic O
equilibrium O
with O
a O
third O
object, O
they O
are O
in O
equilibrium O
with O
each O
other. O


Celsius O
thermometers O
have O
the O
reference O
points O
fixed O
at O
the O
freezing O
and O
boiling O

of O
pure O
water. O


If O
we O
then O

any O

such O
