For O

Since O

we O
can O
express O
both O

Mathematically, O

The O

given O
by: O


Sir O
Isaac O
Newton O
first O
presented O
his O
three O
laws O

in O
the O

in O
1686 O


We O
observe O
that O

We O

we O
have O

This O

In O

to O

Obviously O
we O
don't O
encounter O
such O
a O
system O
in O
nature O
and O
to O
explain O
this O

similar O
observations, O

proposed O
a O

But, O
we O
can O
use O
a O
computer O

iteratively O
solve O

On O
this O

we O
show O
a O

This O

in O
each O

the O

one O

A O
vector O
quantity O
has O
two O
characteristics, O
a O

and O
a O

Because O
the O
total O

does O
not O
change O
through O
a O
shock O

the O

A O

If O
the O

we O

If O

the O

if O

Finally, O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
slide, O
we O
consider O
the O
changes O
for O
a O
fluid O
that O
is O
moving O
through O
our O
domain. O


Turning O
to O
the O
larger O
scale, O
the O
pressure O
is O
a O
state O

of O
a O
gas, O
like O
the O

the O

where O
R O

Integrating O

Actual O

Properties O
which O

on O
the O

are O
called O
extensive O

while O
properties O
that O
do O
not O
depend O
on O
the O

If O
we O
perform O
a O
little O
algebra O
on O
the O
first O
law O

thermodynamics, O
we O
can O
begin O
to O
group O
some O
terms O
of O
the O
equations. O


Then O
considering O
the O
compressible O
mass B-CONCEPT

equation. O


Since O
the O

defining O
the O

a O

The O

But O
in O

When O

we O

This O

the O

Theorem O

So O
if O

we O
have O
shown O
that O

The O

it O

Similarly, O
we O

we O

The O

If O
we O
assume O
that O
the O

we O

use O
these O

a O

just O
a O

This O

which, O
in O

In O
the O

the O

be O

and O
the O

could O
produce O

Since O
a O

some O

used O

Unfortunately, O
the O

If O

with O

a O

Since O

the O

For O

The O

it O

the O

This O

The O

in O

both O
the O

For O

compressibility O

the O

an O

and O
the O
amount O

And O
we O
know O
that O
the O

an O

when O
we O
heat O

can O
also O

Because O
a O

there O

the O

by O
conserving O

energy. O


Therefore, O
the O

at O

be O

the O

GENERAL O
INSTRUCTIONS O


But O
in O
supersonic O
flows, O
there O
are O
two O
changes; O
the O
velocity O
and O
the O
density. B-CONCEPT


The O
turbine O
works O
like O
a O
windmill. O


Most O
modern, O
high O
speed B-CONCEPT
passenger O
and O
military O
aircraft O
are O
powered O
by O
gas O
turbine O
engines. O


Now O
we O
use O
the O
conservation O
of O
momentum B-CONCEPT
equation: O


This O
location O
is O
called O
the O
throat O
of O
the O
nozzle. O


To O
change O
the O
value O
of O
an O
input O
variable, O
simply O
move O
the O
slider. O


Regardless O
of O
gravity, O
a O
liquid O
has O
a O
fixed O
volume. O


The O
Euler O
equations O
neglect O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
viscosity O
of O
the O
fluid O
which O
are O
included O
in O
the O
Navier-Stokes O
equations. O


We O
must, O
therefore, O
use O
the O
longer O
version O
of O
the O
generalized O
thrust O
equation O
to O
describe O
the O
thrust O
of O
the O
system. O


The O
value O
of O
the O
new O
constant O
depends O
on O
the O
type O
of O
gas O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
universal O
gas O
constant, O
which O
is O
the O
same O
for O
all O
gases. O


Mathematicians O
would O
say O
that O
the O
blue O
and O
the O
red O
triangles O
are O
similar O
triangles; O
the O
angles O
are O
equal, O
but O
the O
size O
is O
different. O


The O
flow O
then O
passes O
through O
the O
nozzle O
which O
is O
shaped O
to O
accelerate O
the O
flow. O


We O
will O
present O
some O
simple O
examples O
of O
these O
laws O
and O
properties O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
physical O
systems, O
although O
we O
are O
most O
interested O
in O
the O
thermodynamics O
of O
propulsion O
systems O
and O
high O
speed B-CONCEPT
flows. O


Since O
the O
area O
ratio O
depends O
only O
on O
the O
Mach O
number O
and O
ratio O
of O
specific O
heats, O
the O
program O
can O
calculate O
the O
value O
of O
the O
area O
ratio O
and O
display O
the O
results O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
output O
variables. O


Here O
are O
some O
simple O
rules O
for O
working O
with O
ratios O
that O
apply O
to O
all O
scalar O
quantities: O


It O
helps O
to O
explain O
the O
generation O
of O
lift O
from O
an O
airfoil. O


Rocket O
engines O
usually O
have O
a O
fixed O
geometry O
CD O
nozzle O
with O
a O
much O
larger O
divergent O
section O
than O
is O
required O
for O
a O
gas O
turbine. O


Thus O
the O
mass B-CONCEPT
at O
point O
a O
ma O
is O
simply O
density B-CONCEPT
r O
times O
the O
volume O
at O
a. O


There O
have O
been O
several O
design O
studies O
to O
build O
air-breathing, O
hypersonic O
cruising O
aircraft. O


The O
wedges O
are O
numbered O
with O
black O
numerals O
that O
correspond O
to O
the O
wedge O
angle O
numbers O
on O
the O
input O
panel. O


The O
static O
pressure O
p O
increases O
to: O


But O
under O
low O
hypersonic O
flow O
conditions O
or O
high O
total O
temperature B-CONCEPT
conditions, O
air O
is O
calorically O
imperfect. O


From O
the O
conservation O
of O
mass B-CONCEPT
in O
three O
dimensions, O
a O
change O
in O
velocity O
in O
the O
streamwise O

causes O
a O
change O
in O
velocity O
in O
the O
other O
directions O
as O

The O

is O
unique O
because O
the O

the O

And O
the O

the O
observation O
that O
if O
two O

because O

Because, O
to O
conserve O
mass B-CONCEPT
in O
a O
supersonic O
(compressible) O
flow, O
both O
the O
density B-CONCEPT
and O
the O

are O
changing O

we O

In O

The O
