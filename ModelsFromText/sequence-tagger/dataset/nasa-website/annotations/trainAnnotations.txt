There are mathematical models determined from statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases that account for this effect on isentropic flows, oblique, and normal shocks.
There are three principal laws of thermodynamics which are described on separate slides.
There is no upstream influence in a supersonic flow; disturbances are only transmitted downstream within the cone.
In engine operation, we can set the fuel flow rate which determines a value for the fuel/air ratio f and sets the B-CONCEPT_temperature ratio in the burner.
s2 - s1 = cv * ln ( T2 / T1) + R * ln ( v2 / v1)
The Mach number depends on the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound in the gas and the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound depends on the type I-CONCEPT_of gas and the B-CONCEPT_temperature I-CONCEPT_of the gas.
With a little algebra, this energy equation can be solved for the B-CONCEPT_temperature ratio across the burner:
And to make it even more confusing, the flow conditions in and near the boundary layer are often unsteady (changing in B-CONCEPT_time).
The older version 1.1f of the program is still available if you prefer a simpler version.
The flow of gas reacts to the edge of the boundary layer as if it was the physical surface of the object.

The equations to compute area and volume are used every day by design engineers.
If the airflow demanded by the engine is much less than the airflow that can be captured by the inlet, then the difference in airflow is spilled around the inlet.
Another simulator helps you study how pressure changes across shock waves that occur at high speeds.
It is believed that he learned the theorem during his studies in Egypt.
Dealing with B-CONCEPT_momentum is more difficult than dealing with B-CONCEPT_mass and energy because B-CONCEPT_momentum is a vector quantity having both a magnitude and a direction.
In the first process, the curved line from State 1 to State2, no heat was transferred to the gas; the process was adiabatic.
The velocity gradient is indicated by del u / del x; the change in velocity per change in distance.

p * delta v = R * delta T
If the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity is a constant value, the gas is said to be calorically perfect and if the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity changes, the gas is said to be calorically imperfect.
The thrust equation shown above works for both liquid and solid rocket engines.
On the the small scale, from the kinetic theory of gases, a gas is composed of a large number of molecules that are very small relative to the distance between molecules.
And again, a slip surface is generated between zones "3" and "4".
There are three principal laws of thermodynamics which are described on separate slides.
We observe that there are some quantities and processes in our world that depend on the direction in which they occur, and there are some quantities that do not depend on direction.
To properly model these effects, aerodynamicists use similarity parameters which are ratios of these effects to other forces present in the problem.
We can determine the exit pressure pe and exit B-CONCEPT_temperature Te from the isentropic relations at the nozzle exit:

In the same way that potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy while conserving the total energy of the system, the internal energy of a thermodynamic system can be converted to either kinetic or potential energy.
For a fluid (a liquid or a gas) the B-CONCEPT_density, volume, and shape of the object can all change within the domain with B-CONCEPT_time and B-CONCEPT_mass can move through the domain.
Notice that there is no free stream B-CONCEPT_mass times free stream velocity term in the thrust equation because no external air is brought on board.
The Pythagorean Theorem can be used with the trigonometric functions to determine the size of all the sides of a right triangle.

For all other conditions, we must include the third term of the thrust equation (exit pressure minus free stream pressure times the exit area).
An efficient engine has a low value of sfc and burns little fuel to produce thrust.
The interactions of the molecules introduce some other properties that we normally do not encounter when dealing with solids.
But in a gas, the molecules can move around and interact with each other and with their surroundings in different ways.
The equation of state of a gas relates the B-CONCEPT_temperature, pressure, and volume through a gas constant R .

Both the nitrogen and the oxygen experience vibrational excitation.
Since thermodynamics deals only with the macro scale, the change in entropy delta S is defined here to be the heat transfer delta Q into the system divided by the B-CONCEPT_temperature T:
From a study of the first law of thermodynamics, we find that the internal energy of a gas is also a state variable, that is, a variable which depends only on the state of the gas and not on any process that produced that state.
The combustion that produces thrust in the ramjet occurs at a subsonic B-CONCEPT_speed in the combustor.
The parts of the engine are described on other slides.

As you choose a different component, the part of the engine being affected is highlighted in the graphic by changing from its default color to yellow.
The numbering scheme for the ramjet is identical to the turbine engine.
This happens because the flow in the boundary has very low energy (relative to the free stream) and is more easily driven by changes in pressure.

When an object moves faster than the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound, and there is an abrupt decrease in the flow area, shock waves are generated.
A solid rocket is much easier to handle and can sit for years before firing.
To make things more confusing, the boundary layer may separate from the body and create an effective shape much different from the physical shape.
A 90 degree angle is called a right angle and that is where the right triangle gets its name.
We can sense that one gas is hotter than another gas and therefore has a higher B-CONCEPT_temperature.

The exp function is the special function whose slope (rate of change) is equal to the value of the function.
If the properties are transported by the random motion, the process is called diffusion.
ni = pt2 / pt1
Because we are dealing with a nearly infinite number of molecules and because the motion of the individual molecules is random in every direction, we do not detect any motion.
It is observed that, if we have a certain amount (B-CONCEPT_mass or volume) of gas present, the value of the B-CONCEPT_temperature and pressure does not depend on the amount of gas which we examine.
For B-CONCEPT_speeds greater than five times the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound, M > 5, the flow is said to be hypersonic.

Because the inlet does no thermodynamic work, the total B-CONCEPT_temperature through the inlet is constant.
divide by (r * V * A) to get:
For higher Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer is turbulent and the streamwise velocity is characterized by unsteady (changing with B-CONCEPT_time) swirling flows inside the boundary layer.
For aircraft that cannot go faster than the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound, like large airliners, a simple, straight, short inlet works quite well.

Across the shock wave the Mach number decreases to a value specified as M1:
As an object moves through a gas, the gas molecules near the object are disturbed and move around the object.
In real fluids, however, the B-CONCEPT_density does not remain fixed as the velocity increases because of compressibility effects.
Using the sine and cosine relations from trigonometry:
The quantity B-CONCEPT_density times area times velocity has the dimensions of B-CONCEPT_mass/time and is called the B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate.
The result of our thermodynamic analysis is a certain value of B-CONCEPT_specific I-CONCEPT_impulse.

The details of how to mix and burn the fuel and oxidizer, without blowing out the flame, are very complex.
Either the specific volume or the B-CONCEPT_density can be used in defining the state of the gas using only intensive variables.
That's why a rocket will work in space, where there is no surrounding air, and a gas turbine or propeller will not work.
Our web print fonts don't allow for this notation, so we will use a bold letter for a vector.

Thrust is the B-CONCEPT_force which moves any aircraft through the air.
If the upstream Mach number is in the low supersonic regime, the specific heat ratio of air remains a constant value (1.4) and air is said to be calorically perfect.
Assuming the equivalent velocity remains constant with B-CONCEPT_time, we can integrate the equation to get:
If the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity is a constant value, the gas is said to be calorically perfect and if the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity changes, the gas is said to be calorically imperfect.

The hot exhaust flow is choked at the throat, which means that the Mach number is equal to 1.0 in the throat and the B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate m dot is determined by the throat area.
The conservation of energy is a fundamental concept of physics along with the conservation of B-CONCEPT_mass and the conservation of B-CONCEPT_momentum.
The shearing of the flow of air creates a layer of air near the surface, called a boundary layer, which, in effect, changes the shape of the object.
Again, aerodynamicists rely on wind tunnel testing and sophisticated computer analysis to predict these conditions.
Careful, scientific observation has determined that these variables are related to one another, and the values of these properties determine the state of the gas.
That's why they are called standard values.
Small scale gas interactions are described by the kinetic theory of gases.
We can use equations for the entropy to relate the flow variables of the system.

As aerodynamicists, we are most interested in the thermodynamics of propulsion systems and high B-CONCEPT_speed flows.
On the macro scale, the properties of the gas can change with altitude and depend on the thermodynamic state of the gas.
Thrust is used to accelerate the aircraft, to change its velocity, and thrust is used to balance the drag when the aircraft is cruising at a constant velocity.
and the value of total B-CONCEPT_temperature depends on the Mach number of the flow.
nu = {sqrt[(gam+1)/(gam-1)]} * atan{sqrt[(gam-1)*(M^2 - 1)/(gam+1)]} - atan{sqrt[M^2 -1]}
Through an expansion fan, the Mach number increases, the static pressure decreases and the total pressure remains constant.
B = (A * pt) / sqrt(Tt) * sqrt(gam / R)
This is the second part sited in Newton's first law; a net external B-CONCEPT_force changes the velocity of the object.
During the process of reaching B-CONCEPT_thermal I-CONCEPT_equilibrium, heat is transferred between the objects.
The units of work is the Joule, which is equal to a Newton - meter.
All of the dependent variables are functions of both x and y. The differential equations are therefore partial differential equations and not ordinary differential equations that you study in a beginning calculus class.
mdot = (A * pt/sqrt[Tt]) * sqrt(g/R) * M * [1 + M^2 * (g-1)/2]^-[(g+1)/(g-1)/2]
This equation tells us how the velocity V changes when the area A changes, and the results depend on the Mach number M of the flow.

We claim that the value of each ratio depends only on the value of the angle c formed by the adjacent and the hypotenuse.
M^2 = 1 / (D * ( 2 * C - 1))
This is called the Pythagorean Theorem and has been know since ancient times:
The equation for the volume is two times pi times the diameter d squared times the height h divided by fifteen;
So if we can exactly fill up the square on the hypotenuse, we have shown that the areas are equal.
If the size of our container were decreased to 1 meter on all sides, as in Case #3, and we kept the same number of molecules, that B-CONCEPT_density would increase to .52 kg/cubic meter.
The multiplier (.59352) is computed from reference conditions, so it never changes.
Similarly, we can add the y-components:
The static pressure is constant across a slip line although the Mach number changes.
The conservation of B-CONCEPT_momentum states that, within some problem domain, the amount of B-CONCEPT_momentum remains constant; B-CONCEPT_momentum is neither created nor destroyed, but only changed through the action of forces as described by Newton's laws of motion.
dQ = C (constant pressure) * dT - R * T dp / p
During the motion of the piston, we are going to assume that no heat is transferred into the cylinder.
W = F * s
Comparing this result with example two we find that:
If the B-CONCEPT_mass and B-CONCEPT_temperature are held constant, the product of the pressure and volume are observed to be nearly constant for a real gas.
The amount of B-CONCEPT_mass flow is usually set by flow choking in the nozzle throat.
To simplify the exercise, let us define:
The surface may be fully insulated, or it may undergo a physical change of state from solid to liquid to gas as it burns away.
"Gamma" is just a number that depends on the gas.
Exactly how the air re-acts to the aircraft depends upon the ratio I-CONCEPT_of the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the aircraft to the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound through the air.
At the top of the screen is a graphic of the propulsion system that you are studying.
It is possible to perform a series of processes, in which the state is changed during each process, but the gas eventually returns to its original state.
Using the conservation of B-CONCEPT_mass, B-CONCEPT_momentum, and energy and the definition of total B-CONCEPT_enthalpy in the flow, we can derive the following relations:
An efficiency factor is applied, as well, to account for losses during burning.
r * V * dV = - (a^2) * dr
In the liquid phase the molecular forces are weaker than in a solid.
Derived flow variables, like the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound and the isentropic flow relations are slightly different for a calorically imperfect gas than the conditions predicted for a calorically perfect gas because some I-CONCEPT_of the energy I-CONCEPT_of the flow excites the vibrational modes I-CONCEPT_of the diatomic molecules I-CONCEPT_of nitrogen and oxygen in the air.
+ 1/Re * { partialtauxx/partialx + partialtauxy/partialy + partialtauxz/partialz}
Because the scramjet uses external air for combustion, it is a more efficient propulsion system for flight within the atmosphere than a rocket, which must carry all of its oxygen.

In all of the shock refections and intersections the Mach number of the flow is decreased.
It is a property of a gas which appears in many compressible flow equations.
a = sqrt(gam * p / r) = sqrt (gam * R * T)
Since the flow is isentropic, it is reversible.
The value of the compression ratio is a function of the design of the bore and stroke of the piston.

There are four independent variables in the problem, the x, y, and z spatial coordinates of some domain, and the B-CONCEPT_time t. There are six dependent variables; the pressure p, B-CONCEPT_density r, and B-CONCEPT_temperature T (which is contained in the energy equation through the total energy Et) and three components of the velocity vector; the u component is in the x direction, the v component is in the y direction, and the w component is in the z direction, All of the dependent variables are functions of all four independent variables.
The change in pressure during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics.
Different propulsion systems develop thrust in different ways, but all thrust is generated through some application of Newton's third law of motion.

The inlet is usually sized to pass the maximum airflow that the engine can ever demand and, for all other conditions, the inlet spills the difference between the actual engine airflow and the maximum air demanded.
If we try to run the engine hotter than this maximum B-CONCEPT_temperature, the burner and the turbine will be damaged.
The FoilSim program shows you how the pressure varies around a lifting wing, and the EngineSim program shows how the pressure changes through a turbine engine.
Why the big difference?

The process of bringing them to the same B-CONCEPT_temperature is irreversible.
As the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the object increases towards the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound, we must consider compressibility effects on the gas.
The reason for this choice is that most standard engineering measurements are based on diameter, not radius.
The value for air at standard conditions is 1.4.
The total B-CONCEPT_temperature depends on the local, atmospheric, static B-CONCEPT_temperature and on the velocity of the aircraft.
As a spacecraft re-enters the earth's atmosphere, it is traveling very much faster than the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound.
Using either process we change the state of the gas from State 1 to State 2. But the work for the constant pressure process is greater than the work for the curved line process.
There are several different types of gas turbine engines, but all turbine engines have some parts in common.
If we compare the flow through another point in the domain, point "b," for the same amount of B-CONCEPT_time t, we find the B-CONCEPT_mass at "b" mb to be the B-CONCEPT_density B-CONCEPT_times the velocity B-CONCEPT_times the area B-CONCEPT_times the B-CONCEPT_time at "b":

If we assume that the B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity is constant with B-CONCEPT_temperature, we can use these two equations to define the change in B-CONCEPT_enthalpy and internal energy.
where cp is the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity at constant pressure, and (cp)perf is the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity for a calorically perfect gas.
So knowing the Mach number, we can determine all the conditions associated with the normal shock.
Since the Mach number is related to the velocity, we can determine the exit velocity of a nozzle, if we know the area ratio from the throat to the exit.

We are also including an interactive simulator to let you study how B-CONCEPT_temperature varies with height through the atmosphere.
dp/dx + r * u * du/dx = 0
As the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the object approaches the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound, the flight Mach number is nearly equal to one, M = 1, and the flow is said to be transonic.
But, in practice, these equations are too difficult to solve analytically.
Turbine engines and propellers use air from the atmosphere as the working fluid, but rockets use the combustion exhaust gases.
The problem is further simplified by considering a steady flow which does not change with B-CONCEPT_time and by limiting the forces to only those associated with the pressure.
sin = o / h
For an ellipse with a semi-axis a and semi-axis b, the area is given by:
The pressure of a gas equals the perpendicular B-CONCEPT_force exerted by the gas divided by the surface area on which the B-CONCEPT_force is exerted.
Under these conditions, the heated air becomes an ionized plasma of gas and the spacecraft must be insulated from the high temperatures.
There are several different types of gas turbine engines, but all turbine engines have some parts in common.
The Mach number is the ratio I-CONCEPT_of the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the aircraft, or the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the gas, to the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound in the gas.
This is a different working fluid than you find in a turbine engine or a propeller-powered aircraft.
The volume of an object is the three-dimensional space that is occupied by the object and we are taught formulas for computing the volume of some simple three-dimensional objects in middle school.

The advantage to the can-annular design is that the individual cans are more easily designed, tested, and serviced.
So in the atmosphere, B-CONCEPT_density decreases as you increase altitude; there are fewer molecules.
This creates a thin layer of fluid near the surface in which the velocity changes from zero at the surface to the free stream value away from the surface.
From a detailed analysis of the B-CONCEPT_momentum conservation equation, the inertial forces are characterized by the product of the B-CONCEPT_density r times the velocity V times the gradient of the velocity dV/dx. The viscous forces are characterized by the dynamic viscosity coefficient mu times the second gradient of the velocity d^2V/dx^2.
If we construct a dashed line from the tip of the vector a running parallel to the x-axis, it cuts the y-axis at a location we label ay.
Many observations of real gases have shown that the difference of the heat flow into the gas and the work done by the gas depends only on the initial and final states of the gas and does not depend on the process or path which produces the final state.
Note: On this slide, for simplicity, we have developed the components in only two dimensions; there are two coordinate axes.
The state of a gas is defined by several properties including the B-CONCEPT_temperature, pressure, and volume which the gas occupies.
The value of these three flow variables are all determined by the nozzle design.

As the flow moves through the constriction, the pressure, B-CONCEPT_temperature and velocity change, but these variables return to their original values downstream of the constriction.
The earliest studied and most often encountered hypersonic flows involve the re-entry of a spacecraft from orbit around the earth.
That's why a rocket will work in space, where there is no surrounding air, and a gas turbine or propeller will not work.
The drag coefficient is a number which relates the aerodynamic forces on an object to the dynamic pressure times the area of the object.

where ht is the specific total B-CONCEPT_enthalpy, f is the fuel to air B-CONCEPT_mass flow ratio, Q is the heat release, and nb is an efficiency factor.
In the lower stratosphere the B-CONCEPT_temperature is constant and the pressure decreases exponentially.
We divide both sides by "cp" and take the exponential function of both sides (this "un-does" the logarithms).
Pythagoras, for whom the theorem is named, lived in ancient Greece, 2500 years ago.
Because a shock wave does no work, and there is no heat addition, the total B-CONCEPT_enthalpy and the total B-CONCEPT_temperature are constant.
The Egyptians probably knew of the relationship for a thousand years before Pythagoras.

A simplified version of the equations called the Euler equations can be solved for some fluids problems.
But if the gas is moving, the measured pressure depends on the direction of motion.
On this slide we have two versions of the Euler Equations which describe how the velocity, pressure and B-CONCEPT_density of a moving fluid are related.
The ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse is a function of the angle c, so we can write the symbol as cos(c) = value.
M^2 = (2 (Tt/T) / gam) * [(gamma/(gamma-1) * (1 - T/Tt) + (theta/Tt) * (1/(e^theta/Tt -1) - 1/(e^theta/T -1)]
For low B-CONCEPT_speed, or subsonic conditions, the Mach number is less than one, M < 1 and the square of the Mach number is very small.
The B-CONCEPT_temperature of a gas is a measure of the mean kinetic energy of the gas.
Turbine engines and propellers rely on the atmosphere to provide air as the working fluid for propulsion and oxygen in the air as oxidizer for combustion.
As the flow slows, some of the energy associated with the aircraft velocity increases the static pressure of the air and the flow is compressed.

A synopsis of the report is included in NACA-1135.
If the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity is a constant value, the gas is said to be calorically perfect and if the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity changes, the gas is said to be calorically imperfect.

The same value as the red and the blue triangle.
Of particular interest, the forces which operate on a flying aircraft, the weight, thrust, and aerodynmaic forces, are all vector quantities.
At the bottom of the slide, we have divided by the B-CONCEPT_mass of gas to produce the specific B-CONCEPT_enthalpy equation version.
Exactly how the air re-acts to the aircraft depends upon the ratio I-CONCEPT_of the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the aircraft to the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound through the air.
rho/rhot = [(e^(theta/Tt) - 1)/(e^(theta/T) - 1)] * [(T/Tt)^(1/(gamma-1))] * exp[(theta/T) * (e^(theta/T)/(e^(theta/T) -1)) - (theta/Tt) * (e^(theta/Tt)/(e^(theta/Tt) -1)) ]
The effects of both heat flow and work are combined in the First Law of Thermodynamics.
The B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate equation developed on the conservation of B-CONCEPT_mass web page is a one dimensional solution of the continuity equation shown here.
sin(mu) = a / v
The second law states that if the physical process is irreversible, the combined entropy of the system and the environment must increase.
tan(b) = a
For a moving flow, there is a dynamic B-CONCEPT_temperature associated with the kinetic energy of ordered motion of the flow in the same way that static B-CONCEPT_temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the random motion of the molecules.
The key point here is that if there is no net B-CONCEPT_force acting on an object (if all the external B-CONCEPT_forces cancel each other out) then the object will maintain a constant velocity.
W = F * s
The program screen is divided into three main parts:
As we increase altitude through the atmosphere, there is some air below us and some air above us.
gamma = cp / cv
The boundary layer is very important in determining the drag of an object.
The ratio I-CONCEPT_of the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the aircraft to the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound in the gas determines the magnitude I-CONCEPT_of many I-CONCEPT_of the compressibility effects.
The metric units curve fits for the lower stratosphere are:
If the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the object is much less than the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound I-CONCEPT_of the gas, the B-CONCEPT_density I-CONCEPT_of the gas remains constant and the flow I-CONCEPT_of gas can be described by conserving B-CONCEPT_momentum, and energy in the flow.
For ramjet and scramjet inlets, the materials used in the inlet must withstand high temperatures.
- (M^2) * dV / V + dV / V + dA / A = 0
The relationship between B-CONCEPT_temperature and volume, at a constant number of moles and pressure, is called Charles and Gay-Lussac's Law in honor of the two French scientists who first investigated this relationship.
The yellow square has dimensions b - a on each side.
m = r * A * V * t
The dynamic pressure is a defined property of a moving flow of gas.
The B-CONCEPT_density of the gas varies from one location to the next.
These conditions set the strength of the two new shocks (3 and 4).
The change in B-CONCEPT_momentum produces a B-CONCEPT_force on the walls which is related to the gas pressure.
Air is a mixture of gases with the major components being diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen.
Newton worked in many areas of mathematics and physics.
Here is a Java program that solves the equations given on this page.
As the air spills over the external cowl lip, the air accelerates and the pressure decreases.

e2 - e1 + k2 - k1 = q - w
The high forces and high heat dictate that the Shuttle has short, blunt wings.
The B-CONCEPT_force on the vehicle can be modeled using simple Newtonian flow.
If we travel with the object as it moves through the air, the air moves past the object at the B-CONCEPT_speed of the object.
If no heat is added, and there are no pressure losses in the nozzle, the total pressure and B-CONCEPT_temperature are also constant.
Charles did the original work, which was verified by Gay-Lussac.

We can use the equation of state to derive the relation between the volume change and the pressure change.
These equations can be integrated from condition "1" to condition "2" to give:
Gas molecules move around an object as it passes through.
The nozzle sits downstream of the power turbine.
The generation of sound waves is an isentropic process.
A nozzle is a relatively simple device, just a specially shaped tube through which hot gases flow.
This creates a layer of air near the surface, called a boundary layer, which, in effect, changes the shape of the object.
In the supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, the losses associated with slowing the flow would be minimized and the engine could produce net thrust for a hypersonic vehicle.
Since a ramjet cannot produce static thrust, some other propulsion system must be used to accelerate the vehicle to a B-CONCEPT_speed where the ramjet begins to produce thrust.
We have some experience with B-CONCEPT_temperature that we don't have with properties like viscosity and compressibility.
We are all aware that pressure and B-CONCEPT_temperature of the air depend on your location on the earth and the season of the year.
Substituting for our expressions for velocity and pressure:
The shock wave then strikes a solid wall and reflects from the wall generating a new shock.
The equation relating Mach number and total B-CONCEPT_temperature must be solved iteratively to obtain a value for the total B-CONCEPT_temperature.
In a hot gas, the molecules move faster than in a cold gas; the B-CONCEPT_mass remains the same, but the kinetic energy, and hence the B-CONCEPT_temperature, is greater because of the increased velocity of the molecules.
Here are tables of the sine, cosine, and tangent which you can use to solve problems.
B-CONCEPT_Momentum is conserved in all three physical directions at the same B-CONCEPT_time.
Engineers use a thermodynamic analysis of the ramjet to predict thrust and fuel flow for a particular design.
The exponential function, exp(X) or e^X, is a special function that comes from calculus.
Unfortunately, the numbering system for the three laws of thermodynamics is a bit confusing.
Typical low earth orbit re-entry speeds are near 17,500 mph and the Mach number M is nearly twenty five, M < 25.
If we have two surfaces, as shown in the figure, with one surface fixed and the other surface moving parallel to the fixed surface, a shearing B-CONCEPT_force is generated in the fluid between the surfaces.
We can divide this equation by the weight of the propellants to define the B-CONCEPT_specific I-CONCEPT_impulse.
And to make it even more confusing, the flow conditions in and near the boundary layer are often unsteady (changing in B-CONCEPT_time).
In a ramjet, the high pressure is produced by "ramming" external air into the combustor using the forward B-CONCEPT_speed of the vehicle.
Solid
where pt is the total pressure and Tt is the total B-CONCEPT_temperature.
The model has three zones with separate curve fits for the troposphere, the lower stratosphere, and the upper stratosphere.
Since there is no heat transferred into the cylinder and no other losses, the change in entropy is zero.
The transfer of heat goes from the hot object to the cold object.
Wedge "a" generates a shock wave with the conditions downstream of this shock noted as zone "1".
Understanding B-CONCEPT_density and how it works is fundamental to the understanding of rocket aerodynamics.
For a sphere, the center cannot be reached since it is inside the body.
The stagnation B-CONCEPT_temperature is important because it is the B-CONCEPT_temperature that occurs at a stagnation point on the object.
This corresponds to air B-CONCEPT_density at about 13 kilometers altitude.
There are fluid dynamic equations, called the Boltzman equations, which include the electro-magnetic forces with the normal fluid forces of the Navier-Stokes equations.
The boundary layer is very important in determining both the drag and lift of an object.
For propulsion systems, compressibility affects the amount of B-CONCEPT_mass that can pass through an engine and the amount of thrust generated by a rocket or turbine engine nozzle.
And we know that the B-CONCEPT_temperature of an object changes when we heat the object or cool it.
The ShockModeler simulation program, shown above, can also be used to study the intersection and reflection of multiple shock waves.
Because a shock wave does no work, and there is no heat addition, the total B-CONCEPT_enthalpy and the total B-CONCEPT_temperature are constant through the shock.
It fits exactly along the side of the hypotenuse square because the sides of a square are equal.
From our definition of the B-CONCEPT_heat transfer, we can represent Q by some B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity coefficient Cp times the B-CONCEPT_temperature T.
The burner at the left is an annular combustor with the liner sitting inside the outer casing which has been peeled open in the drawing.
When scientists began to study the coldest possible B-CONCEPT_temperature, they determined an absolute zero at which molecular kinetic energy is a minimum (but not strictly zero!).
The sea level standard value of air viscosity mu is
v2 / v1 = (p2 / p1) ^ ( - 1/gamma)
This explains why a rocket works in space but a turbine engine or a propeller does not work.
But because the flow is non-isentropic, the total pressure downstream of the shock is always less than the total pressure upstream of the shock; there is a loss of total pressure associated with a shock wave.
Most of the hot exhaust has come from the surrounding air.
mdot = r * V * A
sin(c) = cos (d)
For the B-CONCEPT_temperature T and the pressure p, the Imperial units curve fits for the troposphere are:
There are several different types of jet engines, but all jet engines have some parts in common.
In all of these cases, the excitation of the vibrational modes cause the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity to become a function of B-CONCEPT_temperature and no longer a single constant value.
A solution of this B-CONCEPT_momentum equation gives us the form of the dynamic pressure that appears in Bernoulli's Equation.
We will call the free stream region zone "0" as shown in red.
- M^2 dV / V = drho / rho
You can also select Prandtl-Meyer angle as an input, and see its effect on the flow variables downstream of the turning.
For the picture at the right, we only see the outside of the rocket nozzle, with the hot gas exiting out the bottom.
Thrust is generated by the propulsion system of the aircraft.
For supersonic and hypersonic flows, small disturbances are transmitted downstream within a cone.
E2 - E1 = Q - W
The tau variables are components of the stress tensor.
The core flow exits the center nozzle while the fan flow exits the annular nozzle.
The area ratio from the throat to the exit Ae sets the exit velocity Ve and the exit pressure pe.
If we shrink our domain down to differential sizes, these gradients become differentials:
The compressibility effects on B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate have some unexpected results.
Eventually, the new drag equals the new thrust level and at that point, the forces again balance out, and the B-CONCEPT_acceleration stops.
In a turbojet engine, the high pressure in the combustor is generated by a piece of machinery called a compressor.
The lower right portion of the simulator provides output information.
There is no free stream air brought into the propulsion system, so the thrust equation simplifies to:
We call this change the weather.
F = m * (v1 - v0) / (t1 - t0)
The flow in zone "2" is parallel to the solid wall and the conditions in zone "2" are given by the oblique shock relations with the upstream conditions being the conditions in zone "1".
The details of the analysis were given by Eggers in NACA Report 959.
As opposed to the compressor and power turbine, we cannot simply relate the total B-CONCEPT_temperature ratio in the burner to the total pressure ratio because the physical processes are different.
dH = dQ = C (constant pressure) * dT
The zeroth law of thermodynamics begins with a simple definition of thermodynamic equilibrium .
d = 180 - 90 - c
While the free stream velocity may be either subsonic or supersonic, the flow exiting the inlet of a ramjet is always subsonic.
T/Tt = (1 + .5 * (gam -1) * M^2) ^-1
Near and beyond the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound, about 330 m/s or 760 mph at sea level, small disturbances in the flow are transmitted to other locations isentropically or with constant entropy.
Let's consider an amount of fluid that passes through point "a" of our domain in some amount of B-CONCEPT_time t. If the fluid passes through an area A at velocity V, we can define the volume Vol to be:
The heat transferred to a gas not only depends on the initial and final states of the gas but also on the process used to change the state.
For subsonic flight speeds, these losses are the only losses.
Engineers use a slightly different form of the equation of state that is specialized for a particular gas.
ps + .5 * r * u^2 = constant = pt
The equations were derived independently by G.G. Stokes, in England, and M. Navier, in France, in the early 1800's.
The Component Performance output panel shows the variation of total pressure and B-CONCEPT_temperature through the engine.
The dynamic pressure is therefore used in the definition of the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient.
Exactly how the air re-acts to the aircraft depends upon the ratio I-CONCEPT_of the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the aircraft to the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound through the air.
If we bring two objects that are initially at different temperatures into physical contact, they eventually achieve B-CONCEPT_thermal I-CONCEPT_equilibrium.
On this page we present the physics which govern the intersection of two shock waves and include a Java program that you can use to investigate these flow problems.
The sound waves strike the edge of the cone at a right angle and the B-CONCEPT_speed of the sound wave is denoted by the letter a. The flow is moving at velocity v which is greater than a. From trigonometry, the sine of the cone angle mu is equal to the ratio of a and v:
Continuity: partialr/partialt + partial(r * u)/partialx + partial(r * v)/partialy + partial(r * w)/partialz = 0
The nozzle pressure ratio depends on the exit static pressure and the nozzle total pressure.
Different propulsion systems develop thrust in different ways, but all thrust is generated through some application of Newton's third law of motion.
The conservation of B-CONCEPT_mass is a fundamental concept of physics.
The chief characteristic of re-entry aerodynamics is that the B-CONCEPT_temperature of the flow is so great that the chemical bonds of the diatomic molecules of the air are broken.
A square is the special case of a rectangle in which all the sides are equal in B-CONCEPT_length.
How does a turbojet work?
using the definition of the Mach number M = V / a. Now we substitute this value of (dr /r) into the B-CONCEPT_mass flow equation to get:
The compressibility effects on B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate have some unexpected results.
The same value as for the red triangle.
What does this expression tell us about the role of the Mach number in compressible flows?
The velocity, B-CONCEPT_force, B-CONCEPT_acceleration, and B-CONCEPT_momentum have both a magnitude and a direction associated with them.
Notice, however, that heat and work can not be stored or conserved independently since they depend on the process.
In a ramjet, the high pressure is produced by "ramming" external air into the combustor using the forward B-CONCEPT_speed of the vehicle.
But in a gas, because the molecules are free to move about and collide with one another, a B-CONCEPT_force applied in the vertical direction causes B-CONCEPT_forces in the horizontal direction.
The user must select which flow problem to study by pushing the appropriate button on the blue bar at the top.

Next to the selection, you then type in a value for A/A*.
h2 - h1 + [(u^2) / 2]2 - [(u^2) / 2]1 = q - wsh
The ordered motion is superimposed, or added to, the normal random motion of the molecules.
It can get very confusing when the terms are used interchangeably!
We must, therefore, use the longer version of the generalized thrust equation to describe the thrust of the system.
When comparing two vector quantities of the same type, you have to compare both the magnitude and the direction.
If two of these objects are brought into physical contact there is initially a change in the property of both objects.
[mdot * sqrt(Tt)]/[A * pt] = sqrt(g/R) * M * [1 + M^2 * (g-1)/2]^-[(g+1)/(g-1)/2]
Many of the state properties listed on this slide, such as the work and internal energy depend on the total B-CONCEPT_mass of gas.
As an object moves through a fluid, or as a fluid moves past an object, the molecules of the fluid near the object are disturbed and move around the object.
If you are an experienced user of this calculator, you can use a sleek version of the program which loads faster on your computer and does not include these instructions.
But under low hypersonic conditions, air is calorically imperfect.
The B-CONCEPT_density of a gas is simply the sum of the B-CONCEPT_mass of the molecules divided by the volume which the gas occupies.

The ratio of a scalar quantity a to a scalar quantity b is equal to a divided by b.
As with the calorically perfect case, the conservation of B-CONCEPT_mass, B-CONCEPT_momentum, and energy equations are solved simultaneously to determine the flow conditions across the normal shock.
But micro scale investigations are based on rather simple theories because we cannot actually observe an individual gas molecule in motion.
Sir Isaac Newton first presented his three laws of motion in the "Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis" in 1686.
16 = 4^2
From the continuity equation:
It is important to note that work is only done on, or by the component of the B-CONCEPT_force along the path.
Why are we interested in B-CONCEPT_specific I-CONCEPT_impulse?

p = 2116 * [(T + 459.7)/ 518.6]^5.256
Pressure acts in all directions at a point inside a gas.
Then we must iterate (or look up in a table) to obtain the Mach number in zone "1" which gives that value of the Prandtl-Meyer function.
You can zoom in or out of the graphic by using the slider at the left of the display.
The values and relations of the properties define the state of the gas.
In an incompressible flow, the B-CONCEPT_density is constant and we can remove it from the continuity equation:
Because the molecules are free to move about in a gas, the B-CONCEPT_mass of the gas is normally characterized by the B-CONCEPT_density.
Likewise, the supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, provides high thrust and low weight for hypersonic flight speeds.
The equations are a set of coupled differential equations and they can be solved for a given flow problem by using methods from calculus.
V = constant * T
The B-CONCEPT_force in this problem comes from the pressure gradient.
where E is the internal energy and W is the work done by the system.
The variable geometry causes these nozzles to be heavier than a fixed geometry nozzle, but variable geometry provides efficient engine operation over a wider airflow range than a simple fixed nozzle.
Let us look at a static gas; one that does not appear to move or flow.
This simple observation allows us to create a thermometer.
A / A* = {[(gam+1)/2]^-[(gam+1)/(gam-1)/2]} / M * [1 + M^2 * (gam-1)/2]^[(gam+1)/(gam-1)/2]
The change in pressure during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics.
Low values of the parameter (on the order of 1 hundred) indicate that viscous forces must be considered.
It is also written as shown on the slide sin^-1. Mu is an angle which depends only on the Mach number and is therefore called the Mach angle of the flow.
In the opposed wedges problem the shocks pass through each other and form two additional shocks.
There is a similar absolute B-CONCEPT_temperature corresponding to the Fahrenheit degree.
There is also an efficiency parameter called the B-CONCEPT_specific I-CONCEPT_impulse which works for both types of rockets and greatly simplifies the performance analysis for rocket engines.
The line is colored blue for an oblique shock and magenta when the shock is a normal shock.
Sharp disturbances generate shock waves that affect both the lift and drag of the aircraft, and the flow conditions downstream of the shock wave.
If we consider the motion of an aircraft at a constant altitude, we can neglect the lift and weight.
The program begins with standard materials for the components, but you can change the materials and see the effects on weight of the engine.
At high hypersonic speeds, the molecules break apart producing an electrically charged plasma around the aircraft.
This is normally taken as the definition of inertia.
Vectors are usually denoted on figures by an arrow.
The flow in zone "2" is parallel to wedge "b" and the conditions in zone "2" are again given by the oblique shock relations.
For the given altitude input, the program computes the upstream standard day conditions.
With this equation we can determine the change in pressure for a given compression ratio.
As you can see, for every angle, there is a unique point on the ground that the 8 foot ladder touches, and it is the same point every B-CONCEPT_time we set the ladder to that angle.
cot(a) = tan(90 degrees - a)
The B-CONCEPT_temperature of a gas is a measure of the kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas.
You can study this relationship in more detail at the Animated Gas Lab.

It would appear that we can make the B-CONCEPT_temperature ratio and resulting thrust as large as we want by just increasing the fuel flow rate and the fuel/air ratio.
As the gas cools, the volume decreases to 3.0 cubic meters.
(1 - M^2) * dV / V = - dA / A
In both propulsion systems, a rocket is used to bring the ramjet up to B-CONCEPT_speed before it produces thrust.
During re-entry, the craft is unpowered and strong shock waves generate tremendous heat on the windward side of the vehicle.
A convergent-divergent nozzle will have supersonic exit flow, a simple convergent nozzle will not.
Each law leads to the definition of thermodynamic properties which help us to understand and predict the operation of a physical system.
If the fluid initially passes through an area A at velocity V, we can define a volume of B-CONCEPT_mass to be swept out in some amount of B-CONCEPT_time t. The volume v is:
SCREEN
For a vehicle traveling supersonically, the air entering the engine must be slowed to subsonic speeds by the aircraft inlet.
Shock waves are very thin regions in the gas where the gas properties change by a large amount.
Burners are also used on ramjet and scramjet propulsion systems.
mdot = (A * pt/sqrt[Tt]) * sqrt(gam/R) * M * [1 + M^2 * (gam-1)/2]^-[(gam+1)/(gam-1)/2]
(h2 - h1) = cp * (T2 - T1)
The work done by a gas and the heat transferred to a gas depend on the beginning and ending states of the gas and on the process used to change the state.
The pressure, B-CONCEPT_temperature, and B-CONCEPT_density of the atmosphere constantly change.
X - B-CONCEPT_Momentum: u * partialu/partialx + v * partialu/partialy = - [partialp/partialx] / r
Just type in your own values for material B-CONCEPT_density and B-CONCEPT_temperature limit.
Then hit the red COMPUTE button to send your new value to the program.
At subsonic and low supersonic Mach numbers, air is calorically perfect.
The nozzle performance equations work just as well for rocket engines except that rocket nozzles always expand the flow to some supersonic exit velocity.
We can use the tables to solve problems.
We can generalize this relationship:
The accelerator can be used as a single stage to orbit vehicle, like the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) shown on the figure, or as the re-usable first stage of a two stage booster, like the German Sanger configuration.
The total B-CONCEPT_temperature is the sum of the static B-CONCEPT_temperature and the dynamic B-CONCEPT_temperature.

The (E + p * V) can be replaced by the B-CONCEPT_enthalpy H.
r1 / r0 = [(gam + 1) * M^2 ] / [(gam -1 ) * M^2 + 2]
The compressor acts like many rows of airfoils, with each row producing a small jump in pressure.
Then Eq #10 can be written:
A molecule of water vapor has the same chemical composition, H2O, as a molecule of liquid water or a molecule of ice.
Any substance can occur in any phase.
and
If we divide both sides of the equation by the B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate, we obtain an efficiency parameter called the specific thrust that greatly simplifies the performance analysis for turbine engines.
If the Mach number of the flow is determined, all of the other flow relations can be determined.
You can use either Imperial or Metric units using the red on white menu button.
The burning occurs at a higher pressure than free stream because of the action of the compressor.
To determine the B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate mdot, we divide the B-CONCEPT_mass by the B-CONCEPT_time.
The value of the total B-CONCEPT_temperature of the flow is less for a calorically imperfect gas than for a perfect gas since some of the kinetic energy of the flow is converted to vibrational energy.
There are several different combinations of these variables available for input using the choice button on the input panel.
Many of the flow problems associated with the cruise vehicle also apply to the accelerator.
We define the side of the triangle opposite from the right angle to be the hypotenuse, h. It is the longest side of the three sides of the right triangle.
p / pt = (r / rt)^gam = (T / Tt)^[gam/(gam-1)]
Here's a Java program which solves the expansion fan problem.
The set of equations are:
There is no upstream influence in a supersonic or hypersonic flow; disturbances are only transmitted downstream.
For a gas, work is done when the volume of a gas is changed at some pressure since pressure represents a B-CONCEPT_force per unit area and volume can be related to the surface area and a distance.
We can therefore plot either the physical volume or the specific volume, volume divided by B-CONCEPT_mass, since the change is the same for a constant B-CONCEPT_mass.
DON'T PANIC!.
You can set the altitude by clicking on the aircraft image, holding the mouse button down, and moving the aircraft to a new location.
The key point here is that we have a function that relates the B-CONCEPT_temperature change to the pressure change during a compression process.
The amount of thrust produced by the rocket depends on the B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate through the engine, the exit velocity of the exhaust, and the pressure at the nozzle exit.
When the mixture is ignited, combustion takes place on the surface of the propellant.
The symbol "partial" is used to denote partial differentiation.
The smallest cross-sectional area of the nozzle is called the throat of the nozzle.
We will present some simple examples of these laws and properties for a variety of physical systems, although we are most interested in the thermodynamics of propulsion systems and high B-CONCEPT_speed flows.
The implementation of the first law of thermodynamics for gases introduces another useful state variable called the B-CONCEPT_enthalpy which is described on a separate page.
An increase in the area (dA > 0 ) produces a negative increase (decrease) in the velocity (dV < 0).

Here's a Java program based on the oblique shock equations.
A function is a mathematical process that uniquely relates the value of one variable to the value of another variable in the problem.
The magnitude of these forces depend on the shape of the object, the B-CONCEPT_speed of the object, the B-CONCEPT_mass of the fluid going by the object and on two other important properties of the fluid; the viscosity, or stickiness, and the compressibility, or springiness, of the fluid.
Because gas turbine engines are so important for modern life, we will be providing a lot of information about turbine engines and their operation.
Thermodynamics deals only with the large scale response of a system which we can observe and measure in experiments.
With some additional work, we can derive a very useful function which depends only on the Mach number.
Solving the integrated energy equation with the assumption of variable specific heat, one obtains an equation for the Mach number in terms of the ratio of the static and total (stagnation) B-CONCEPT_temperature:

The B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_"sound" is actually the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of transmission for small, isentropic disturbances in the gas.
For our purposes, we can consider the burner as simply the place where combustion occurs and where the working fluid (air) B-CONCEPT_temperature is raised with a slight decrease in pressure.
Eventually, the Mach number in some zone becomes too low to support an oblique shock and a terminal, normal shock is formed.
For clarity, the engine thrust is then called the net thrust.
As the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the object approaches the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound, the flight Mach number is nearly equal to one, M = 1, and the flow is said to be transonic.
The combustion section of a ramjet is similar to the gas turbine, but the ramjet needs no power turbine since there is no compressor.
The details of the analysis were given by Eggars in NACA Report 959.
There is an additional propulsion performance penalty charged against the inlet called spillage drag.
g0 = 32.2 ft/sec^2
Thrust is then produced according to Newton's third law of motion.
At the lower Mach numbers, below Mach 3, the values of stagnation B-CONCEPT_temperature are the same, because the B-CONCEPT_temperature is not high enough to excite the vibrational modes.

p * v = R * T
Because of the pressure losses associated with the terminal shock of the inlet, a ramjet has very limited performance beyond Mach 5. Because lift and drag depend on the square of the velocity, hypersonic aircraft do not require a large wing area.
For Mach numbers greater than 5, the frictional heating of the airframe by the air becomes so high that very special nickel alloys are required for the structure.

Derived flow variables, like the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound and the isentropic flow relations are slightly different for a calorically imperfect gas than the conditions predicted for a calorically perfect gas because some I-CONCEPT_of the energy I-CONCEPT_of the flow excites the vibrational modes I-CONCEPT_of the diatomic molecules I-CONCEPT_of nitrogen and oxygen in the air.
If we change the fluid from some state "a" to another state "b" and allow it to come to rest, we find that, unlike a solid, a fluid may change its shape.

Typical speeds for high supersonic aircraft are greater than 1500 mph but less than 2500 mph, and the Mach number M is greater than three, but less than five, 3 < M < 5. In addition to the high temperatures, we encounter compressibility effects and the local air B-CONCEPT_density varies because of shock waves, and expansions.
To account for the effects of B-CONCEPT_mass, we have defined the constant to contain two parts: a universal constant Rbar (on the figure, an R with a bar drawn over the top) and the B-CONCEPT_mass of the gas expressed in moles n. Performing a little algebra, we obtain the more familiar form:
A general derivation of the thrust equation shows that the amount of thrust generated depends on the B-CONCEPT_mass flow through the engine and the exit velocity of the gas.

Subsonic conditions occur for Mach numbers less than one, M < 1 .
Both of these aircraft employed very specialized inlet systems to bring high B-CONCEPT_speed air into the engine.
This cuts the blue square into three pieces, two triangles and a red rectangle.
The equation for the area of a trapezoid is one half the sum of the top t and bottom b times the height h;
At subsonic and low supersonic Mach numbers, air is calorically perfect.
When the thermometer is brought into contact with another object, it quickly establishes a thermodynamic equilibrium.
The line is colored blue for an oblique shock and magenta when the shock is a normal shock.
The chief characteristic of hypersonic aerodynamics is that the B-CONCEPT_temperature of the flow is so great that the chemistry of the diatomic molecules of the air must be considered.
The thrust to weight ratio of the engine is displayed in the numerical output and is a measure of the efficiency of the engine.
At any one B-CONCEPT_time there are great variations in the properties of the atmosphere, depending on location around the planet and height above the surface of the planet.
The word "hypotenuse" comes from two Greek words meaning "to stretch", since this is the longest side.
In one cubic meter the number of molecules is about ten to the 23rd power.
The external flow reacts to the edge of the boundary layer just as it would to the physical surface of an object.
The inlets of the Mach 3+ SR-71 aircraft are specially designed to allow cruising flight at high B-CONCEPT_speed.
The B-CONCEPT_density of the gas varies locally as the gas is compressed by the object.
Curve fits are also available in English units.
For a compound configuration like the Space Shuttle, you have to break up the wing into simple shapes which you can compute, and then add them together.
Eq #1:
Many modern burners have an annular design.
M^2 = (2 (Tt/T) / gam) * [(gamma/(gamma-1) * (1 - T/Tt) + (theta/Tt) * (1/(e^theta/Tt -1) - 1/(e^theta/T -1)]
We then add the expansion angle a to get the value of the Prandtl-Meyer function in zone "1".
Here's an interactive Java program that let's you see that this area relationship is true:
On this figure we show a gas confined in a blue jar in two different states.
We begin with the definition I-CONCEPT_of the Mach number M, and the B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound a:
Generalized solutions of these equations are difficult to obtain.
This computer simulation illustrates molecular vibration:
and use the equation of state
These additional variables are used in the design of high B-CONCEPT_speed inlets, nozzles and ducts.
W = S [p] dV
Remember that mdot is the B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate; it is the amount of exhaust B-CONCEPT_mass per B-CONCEPT_time that comes out of the rocket.
Then:
Most modern passenger and military aircraft are powered by gas turbine engines, which are also called jet engines.
We can determine the nozzle total pressure from the free stream conditions and the engine pressure ratio, EPR.
The procedure to determine the area ratio is shown on this slide:
You can try this experiment at the animated gas lab.
Most modern passenger and military aircraft are powered by gas turbine engines, which are also called jet engines.
The details of the analysis were given by Eggars in NACA Report 959.
Turbine engines and propellers rely on the atmosphere to provide air as the working fluid for propulsion and oxygen in the air as oxidizer for combustion.
We are interested in determining the Mach angle because small disturbances in a supersonic flow are confined to the cone formed by the Mach angle.
The cold object gets colder and the hot object gets hotter, but energy is conserved.
The compressibility of the air alters the important physics between these two cases.
Starting with the small scale action, from the kinetic theory of gases, a gas is composed of a large number of molecules that are very small relative to the distance between molecules.
For a circular cylinder, we need to know the B-CONCEPT_length h of the cylinder and the diameter d of the circular cross section.
sin(mu) = 1 / M
The B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound varies from planet to planet.
However, as the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the flow approaches the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound we must consider compressibility effects on the gas.
You can specify the free stream Mach number by using either the input box or the slider.
The first powered aircraft to explore this regime was the Bell X-1A, in 1947.
The Reynolds number Re then becomes:
(u + (R*T/u))^2 - (u + (R*T/u)) * sqrt[(u + (R*T/u))^2 - 4 * R * T1] - 2 * R * T1 - 2 * u^2 + (gam / (gam -1)) * 4 * R * (T1 - T) + 4 * R * theta * [(1/(e^{theta/T1} - 1)) - (1/(e{theta/T} - 1))] = 0
From a detailed analysis of the B-CONCEPT_momentum conservation equation, the inertial forces are characterized by the product of the B-CONCEPT_density r times the velocity V times the gradient of the velocity dV/dx. The viscous forces are characterized by the viscosity coefficient mu times the second gradient of the velocity d^2V/dx^2.
The third law can be used to explain the generation of lift by a wing and the production of thrust by a jet engine.
It includes an on-line user's manual which describes the various options available in the program and includes hyperlinks to pages in the NASA's Guide to Hypersonics describing the math and science of the propulsion systems.
nu = mu / r
The work and heat transfer depend on the process used to change the state.
The nozzle also sets the total B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate through the engine as described on a separate slide.
For the problem given on the slide, a supersonic flow at Mach number M approaches a wedge of angle a. A shock wave is generated which is inclined at angle s. Then:
So another propulsion system is needed to accelerate the aircraft until the ramjet can generate sufficient thrust.
In the atmosphere, air molecules near the surface of the earth are held together more tightly than the molecules in the higher atmosphere because of the gravitational pull of the earth on all the molecules above the surface molecules.
BPR = pt4 / pt3 = 1.0
As the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the objects increases towards the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound, we must consider compressibility effects on the gas.
From Newton's second law of motion, we can define a B-CONCEPT_force to be the change in B-CONCEPT_momentum of an object with a change in B-CONCEPT_time.
(H2 - H1) = Cp * (T2 - T1)
p1 / p0 = [2* gam * M^2 - (gam - 1)] / (gam + 1)
The area A of a rectangle is the product of the sides.
(p2 * v2) / (p1 * v1) = (p2 / p1) ^ [(gamma - 1)/gamma]
where L is some characteristic B-CONCEPT_length of the problem.
The del p / del x and del u / del x represent the pressure and velocity gradients.
Object #1 and object #2 are in physical contact and in B-CONCEPT_thermal I-CONCEPT_equilibrium.
If you are an experienced user of this simulator, you can use a sleek version of the program which loads faster on your computer and does not include these instructions.
Engine sizing is doen on the particular type of engine (turbine, afterburner, or ramjet) that you select.
Turbine engines come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes because of the many different aircraft missions.
There have been several efforts to develop cost-effective supersonic airliners.
At the molecular level, there is no distinction between the random component and the ordered component.
A/A* = {[(gam+1)/2]^-[(gam+1)/(gam-1)/2]} / Me * [1 + Me^2 * (gam-1)/2]^[(gam+1)/(gam-1)/2]
The amount of work that a gas can do depends on both the initial and final states and on the process used to make the change.
Afterburning turbojets and turbofans require a variable geometry convergent-divergent - CD nozzle as shown on the left.
Following combustion, the hot exhaust is then passed through the nozzle.
The dynamic pressure depends on the gas B-CONCEPT_density and the square of the velocity and is an important design constraint on aircraft structures.
As the engine size changes, the grid background changes in proportion to the size.
The flow is zone "3" has passed through one oblique shock while the flow in zone "2" has gone through two shocks.
From the kinetic theory of gases, a gas is composed of a large number of molecules that are very small relative to the distance between molecules.
Now we use the equation we have derived for the entropy of a gas:
V = (pi * h / 12) * (d^2 + d*b + b^2)
where * denotes multiplication and / denotes division.
atan(a) = b
sin(c) = cos (90 - c)
There is a special simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations that describe boundary layer flows.
If you are an experienced user of this calculator, you can use a sleek version of the program which loads faster on your computer and does not include these instructions.
On the left, in State 1, the gas is at a higher pressure and occupies a smaller volume than in State 2, at the right.
Therefore the condition for the maximum airflow occurs at:
is called the dynamic pressure because it is a pressure term associated with the velocity u of the flow.
You can investigate the effects of inlet performance on total engine performnace by using the EngineSim computer program.
Spec.
If you see only a grey box at the top of this page, be sure that Java is enabled in your browser.
On the left is the graphic showing the altitude of interest and the velocity of your aircraft.
Let us begin with some definitions and terminology which we will use on this slide.
This quantity is an important parameter in determining the thrust produced by a propulsion system.
To allow for the expansion, slip joints are used in many places on the SR-71.
Across a shock wave, the Mach number decreases, the static pressure increases, and there is a loss of total pressure because the process is irreversible.
A quantity which does not depend on direction is called a scalar quantity.
where the numbers 1 and 2 denote the states at the beginning and end of the compression process, s is the entropy, T is the B-CONCEPT_temperature, p is the pressure, and "ln" denotes the natural logarithm function.
dQ = C (constant volume) * dT + R * T dV / V
So if
Then the sum of the other two angles is also 90 degrees.
The user selects the Zone to display by using the choice button.
Propulsion engineers use the specific B-CONCEPT_enthalpy in engine analysis more than the B-CONCEPT_enthalpy itself.
cot(a) = tan(s) * [{((gam+1) * M^2)/(2 * M^2 * sin^2(s) - 1)} - 1]
On this web page, we have listed the equations which describe the change in flow variables for flow across a normal shock.
On 22 June 05 version 1.1a was released.
Using the choice button labeled Input Variable, select "Area Ratio - A/A*".
High B-CONCEPT_temperature real gas effects play a major role in hypersonic aerodynamics.
Y - B-CONCEPT_Momentum: u * partialv/partialx + v * partialv/partialy = - [partialp/partialy] / r
A plasma has some unique qualities that causes scientists to label it a "fourth phase" of matter.
If we use the definition of the B-CONCEPT_enthalpy H of a gas:
Then:
The model assumes that the pressure and B-CONCEPT_temperature change only with altitude.
- 1/(Re*Pr) * { partialqx/partialx + partialqy/partialy + partialqz/partialz}
If we substitute this expression for T into the B-CONCEPT_temperature equation, we obtain:
For example, suppose we have a theoretical gas confined in a jar with a piston at the top.
From kinetic theory, static B-CONCEPT_temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the random motion of the molecules of the gas.
If you are an experienced user of this simulator, you can use a sleek version of the program which loads faster on your computer and does not include these instructions.
If the value of the ratio is very large, then a is very much larger than b or b is nearly zero.
If we divide both equations by the B-CONCEPT_mass of gas, we can obtain intrinsic, or "specific" forms of both equations:
And in engine operation, there is a maximum burner exit B-CONCEPT_temperature Tt4 which is determined by material limits.
The molecules possess the physical properties of B-CONCEPT_mass, B-CONCEPT_momentum, and energy.
To better understand certain problems involving aircraft and propulsion it is necessary to use some mathematical ideas from trigonometry, the study of triangles.
This skill is taught in middle school and used every day by design engineers.
If the Earth were the size of a basketball, a tightly held pillowcase would represent the thickness of the atmosphere.
The word "expansion" denotes that the area is increasing.
The pressure recovery pt2 / pt0 depends on a wide variety offactors, including the shape of the inlet, the B-CONCEPT_speed of the aircraft, the airflow demands of the engine, and aircraft maneuvers.
The details of the analysis were given by Eggars in NACA Report 959.
V / (a^2) * dV = - dr / r
4 = sqrt(16)
dr / r + dV / V + dA / A = 0
In reality, the compression is not isentropic and the compression process line leans to the right because of the increase in entropy of the flow.
This is a can-annular design, in which the casing is annular and the liner is can-shaped.
To generate your own performance plots, select "Generate" from the graphics window.
Substituting this expression for the change of pressure into the conservation of B-CONCEPT_momentum equation gives:
The opposite side is now 3 units long and the adjacent side is now 6 units long.
Diffusion is a physical process that occurs in a flow of gas in which some property is transported by the random motion of the molecules of the gas.
The molecules have the standard physical properties of B-CONCEPT_mass, B-CONCEPT_momentum, and energy.
Each of these spacecraft use an ablative, or "burning", heat shield.
Therefore, air pressure decreases as we increase altitude.
Within some problem domain, the amount of B-CONCEPT_mass remains constant; B-CONCEPT_mass is neither created or destroyed.
At the compressor face, one portion of the flow may have a higher velocity or higher pressure than another portion.
Similarly, for the specific B-CONCEPT_heat I-CONCEPT_capacity at constant pressure:
Early gas turbine engines worked much like a rocket engine creating a hot exhaust gas which was passed through a nozzle to produce thrust.
Looking very closely at these two equations, we notice that they completely define the vector quantity a; they specify both the magnitude and the direction of a. We can find the magnitude of the vector by using the Pythagorean Theorem.
Engineers usually use the lower case letter for the "specific" version of a variable.
The airflow mis-match can produce spillage drag on the aircraft.
As an object moves through a gas, the gas molecules stick to the surface.
Output from the program is displayed in output boxes at the lower right.
Thrust F is equal to the exit B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate mdot e times the exit velocity Ve minus the free stream B-CONCEPT_mass flow rate mdot 0 times the free stream velocity V0 plus the pressure difference across the engine pe - p0 times the engine area Ae.
The first law of thermodynamics relates the various forms of kinetic and potential energy in a system to the work which a system can perform and to the transfer of heat.
(An example of diffusion is the spread of an odor in a perfectly still room).
dp = (a^2) * dr
The military has proposed hypersonic cruise missiles, high altitude, high B-CONCEPT_speed reconnaissance vehicles, and piloted global reach vehicles that could deliver cargo or weapons to any location on earth in just a few hours.
There is a similar relation for the ratio of the static and total pressure p/pt:
If the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of the object is much less than the B-CONCEPT_B-CONCEPT_speed I-CONCEPT_of I-CONCEPT_sound I-CONCEPT_of the gas, the B-CONCEPT_density I-CONCEPT_of the gas remains constant and the flow I-CONCEPT_of gas can be described by conserving B-CONCEPT_momentum and energy.
Therefore, the velocity at "b" must be twice the velocity at "a."
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
But in supersonic flows, there are two changes; the velocity and the B-CONCEPT_density.
The turbine works like a windmill.
Most modern, high B-CONCEPT_speed passenger and military aircraft are powered by gas turbine engines.
Now we use the conservation of B-CONCEPT_momentum equation:
This location is called the throat of the nozzle.
To change the value of an input variable, simply move the slider.
Regardless of gravity, a liquid has a fixed volume.
The Euler equations neglect the effects of the viscosity of the fluid which are included in the Navier-Stokes equations.
We must, therefore, use the longer version of the generalized thrust equation to describe the thrust of the system.
The value of the new constant depends on the type of gas as opposed to the universal gas constant, which is the same for all gases.
Mathematicians would say that the blue and the red triangles are similar triangles; the angles are equal, but the size is different.
The flow then passes through the nozzle which is shaped to accelerate the flow.
We will present some simple examples of these laws and properties for a variety of physical systems, although we are most interested in the thermodynamics of propulsion systems and high B-CONCEPT_speed flows.
Since the area ratio depends only on the Mach number and ratio of specific heats, the program can calculate the value of the area ratio and display the results on the right side of the output variables.
Here are some simple rules for working with ratios that apply to all scalar quantities:
It helps to explain the generation of lift from an airfoil.
Rocket engines usually have a fixed geometry CD nozzle with a much larger divergent section than is required for a gas turbine.
Thus the B-CONCEPT_mass at point "a" ma is simply B-CONCEPT_density r times the volume at "a".
There have been several design studies to build air-breathing, hypersonic cruising aircraft.
The wedges are numbered with black numerals that correspond to the wedge angle numbers on the input panel.
The static pressure p increases to:
But under low hypersonic flow conditions or high total B-CONCEPT_temperature conditions, air is calorically imperfect.
From the conservation of B-CONCEPT_mass in three dimensions, a change in velocity in the streamwise direction causes a change in velocity in the other directions as well.
8 inches of mercury, for example).
The F-14 is unique because the amount of sweep can be varied by the pilot; low sweep for good low B-CONCEPT_speed performance, high sweep for supersonic flight.
mdot = A * M * sqrt (gam * R * T) * p / (R * T)
And the final principle is the observation that if two objects of different temperatures are brought into contact with one another, they will eventually establish a thermodynamic equilibrium.
The "bottom" of the original triangle exactly fits the vertical side of the square, because the sides of a square are equal.
Because, to conserve B-CONCEPT_mass in a supersonic (compressible) flow, both the B-CONCEPT_density and the velocity are changing as we change the area.
In the figure shown above on the right, we have a red gas that is confined in a box.
The base is a circle of diameter d. The volume V of a cone is equal to pi (3.14159) times the diameter d squared times the height h divided by twelve;
The red rectangle has its vertical sides equal to the base of the original triangle, and its horizontal sides equal to the difference between the "bottom" side and the "vertical" side of the original triangle.
The original triangle fits exactly into this region because of two reasons; the vertical sides are identical, and the horizontal side of the red region is equal to the B-CONCEPT_length of the red square plus the horizontal B-CONCEPT_length of the red rectangle which we moved.
Eq #10:
A = h * [ t + b ] / 2
We call this change the weather.
where r is the B-CONCEPT_density of the gas, p is the pressure, x is the direction of the flow, and u is the velocity in the x direction.
H = E + p * V
where gam is the specific heat ratio, R is the gas constant, and T is the B-CONCEPT_temperature.
Or you can display graphs of the variation of the value of pressure and B-CONCEPT_temperature at various stations through the engine.
Tt8 divided by Tt5 is 1.0
Just click on the menu button and click on your selection.
During a flow process, like pushing a gas through a tube, the state of the thermodynamic variables of the gas can change.
Air is a mixture of gases, 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with traces of water vapor, carbon dioxide, argon, and various other components.
where rho is the fluid B-CONCEPT_density, V is the velocity, and p is the pressure.
and the value of total B-CONCEPT_temperature depends on the Mach number of the flow.
Within some problem domain, the amount of B-CONCEPT_mass remains constant; B-CONCEPT_mass is neither created or destroyed.
S2 - S1 = Cp * ln ( T2 / T1) - R * ln ( p2 / p1)
Inside the gas, the pressure acts in all directions.
Changing the direction of the thrust with the nozzle makes the aircraft much more maneuverable.
In aerodynamics, we are most interested in thermodynamics for the role it plays in high B-CONCEPT_speed flight and engine design.
Because ramjets and scramjets can not generate thrust statically, the vehicles would likely employ turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) or rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) engines.
Heat removed from a system would be assigned a negative sign in the equation.
Ideal means no boundary layer losses.
Vectors are usually denoted on figures by an arrow.
But in general, the total pressure and Mach number are not the same in zone "4" and zone "3" because of the different number and strength of shocks that the two flows have encountered.
Diffusion is related to the stress tensor and to the viscosity of the gas.
The flow variables are presented as ratios to the previous zone (up) and to the free stream value (0).
The troposphere runs from the surface of the Earth to 11,000 meters.
The B-CONCEPT_mass of any object can be determined by multiplying the volume of the object by the B-CONCEPT_density of the object.
This view is called a planform of the wing or fin.
The current NASA Space Shuttle, Russian Soyuz, and Chinese Shenzhou must also pass through the hypersonic flow regime.
Now suppose we incline the 8 foot ladder so that its base is 4 feet from the wall.
The work is then equal to the integrated value of the component of the B-CONCEPT_force in the direction of the displacement.
We start with a general triangle.
Oxygen, for example, has 8 protons, 8 neutrons, and 8 electrons.
Thermodynamics deals only with the large scale response of a system which we can observe and measure in experiments.
A synopsis of the report is included in NACA Report 1135.
For other problems, like the growth of the boundary layer on a flat plate, the Euler equations do not properly model the problem.
s2 - s1 = cp ln(T2 / T1) - R ln(p2 / p1)
In the metric system the unit of work is the Joule, in the English system the unit is the foot-pound.
Because the value of "gamma" just depends on the state of the gas, there are tables of these values for given gases.
As an object moves through a gas, the gas molecules are deflected around the object.
The effects of compressibility and viscosity on lift are contained in the lift coefficient and the effects on drag are contained in the drag coefficient.
Therefore, some of the numbered stages are omitted in a ramjet analysis.
