      "Air is a gas, and a very important property of any gas is the speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> sound <I-CONCEPT> through the gas. Why are we interested in the speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> sound? <I-CONCEPT> The speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> \"sound\" <I-CONCEPT> is actually the speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> transmission of a small disturbance through a medium. Sound itself is a sensation created in the human brain in response to sensory inputs from the inner ear. (We won't comment on the old \"tree falling in a forest\" discussion!)\n",

      "Disturbances are transmitted through a gas as a result of collisions between the randomly moving molecules in the gas. The transmission of a small disturbance through a gas is an isentropic process. The conditions in the gas are the same before and after the disturbance passes through. Because the speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> transmission depends on molecular collisions, the speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> sound <I-CONCEPT> depends on the state of the gas. The speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> sound <I-CONCEPT> is a constant within a given gas and the value of the constant depends on the type of gas (air, pure oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.) and the temperature <B-CONCEPT> of the gas. For hypersonic flows, the high temperature <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> the gas generates real gas effects that can alter the speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> sound. <I-CONCEPT> An analysis based on conservation of mass <B-CONCEPT> and momentum <B-CONCEPT> shows that the square of the speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> sound <I-CONCEPT> a^2 is equal to the the gas constant R times the temperature <B-CONCEPT> T times the ratio of. specific heats gamma\n",

      "If the specific heat capacity of a gas is a constant value, the gas is said to be calorically perfect and if the specific heat <B-CONCEPT> capacity <I-CONCEPT> changes, the gas is said to be calorically imperfect. At subsonic and low supersonic Mach numbers, air is calorically perfect. But under low hypersonic conditions, air is calorically imperfect. Derived flow variables, like the speed <B-CONCEPT> of <I-CONCEPT> sound <I-CONCEPT> and the isentropic flow relations are slightly different for a calorically imperfect gas than the conditions predicted for a calorically perfect gas because some of the energy of the flow excites the vibrational modes of <I-CONCEPT> the diatomic molecules of nitrogen and oxygen in the air. The equation given above was derived for a calorically perfect gas. If we include the effects of caloric imperfection, some additional terms are added to the equation.\n",
