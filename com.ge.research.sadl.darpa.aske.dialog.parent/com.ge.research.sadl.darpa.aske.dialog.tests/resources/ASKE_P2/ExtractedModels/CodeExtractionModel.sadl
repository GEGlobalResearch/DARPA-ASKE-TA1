// The reference to a CodeVariable can be its definition (Defined),
//	an assignment or reassignment (Reassigned), or just a reference
//	in the right-hand side of an assignment or a conditional (Used)
Usage is a class, must be one of {Defined, Used, Reassigned}.

// what about Constant also? Note something maybe an input and then gets reassigned
// Constant could be defined in terms of being set by equations that only involve Constants
// Constants could also relate variables used in different equations as being same

{ClassField, MethodArgument, MethodVariable} are types of CodeVariable. 	

//External findFirstLocation (CodeVariable cv) returns int: "http://ToBeImplemented".

Rule Transitive  
if inst is a cls and 
   cls is a type of CodeVariable
then inst is a CodeVariable. 

Rule Transitive2  
if inst is a cls and 
   cls is a type of CodeBlock
then inst is a CodeBlock. 

Rule FindFirstRef
if c is a CodeVariable and
   ref is reference of c and
   ref has codeBlock cb and
   l is beginsAt of ref and
   minLoc = min(c, reference, r, r, codeBlock, cb, r, beginsAt) and
   l = minLoc
then firstRef of ref is true
//	and print(c, " at ", minLoc, " is first reference.")
.

Rule ImplicitInput
if cb is a CodeBlock and
   ref has codeBlock cb and
   ref has firstRef true and
   ref has usage Used
   and cv has reference ref
   and ref has beginsAt loc
then input of ref is true and isImplicit of ref is true
//	and print(cb, cv, loc, " implicit input")
.

Rule ImplicitOutput
if cb is a CodeBlock and
   ref has codeBlock cb and
   ref has firstRef true and
   ref has usage Reassigned
   and cv has reference ref
   and noValue(cv, reference, ref2, ref2, codeBlock, cb, ref2, usage, Defined)
   and ref has beginsAt loc
then output of ref is true and isImplicit of ref is true
//	and print(cb, cv, loc, " implicit output")
