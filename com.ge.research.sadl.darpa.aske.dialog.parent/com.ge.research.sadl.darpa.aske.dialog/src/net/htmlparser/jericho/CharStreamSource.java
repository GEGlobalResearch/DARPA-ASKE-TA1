/**
 * Represents a character stream source.  The purpose of a class that implements this interface is to output text.
 * <p>
 * For small amounts of data, or when memory usage isn't a prime concern (e.g. in client-side applications), the simplest way to obtain the data is by calling
 * the {@link #toString()} method.  
 * If the character stream might contain a large amount of data it is recommended to use the {@link #writeTo(Writer)} method to access the data,
 * especially if running in a multi-user server environment.
 * <p>
 * The advantage of providing textual data via this interface is that it gives the user the choice as to whether they would like to receive the data as a stream
 * of characters, or all as a single string.  Furthermore, it allows the "active" stream source (see below) to be easily converted into a "passive" stream source 
 * if required.
 * <p>
 * An <i><a name="Active">active stream source</a></i> is a stream source that actively outputs to a passive receiver ("sink").
 * The {@link #writeTo(Writer)} method in this interface signifies an active source as the transmission of the entire data stream takes place when this method is executed.
 * In this case the sink is the object that supplies the <code>Writer</code> object, and would typically contain a <code>getWriter()</code> method.
 * The sink is passive because it just supplies a <code>Writer</code> object to be written to by the code in some other class.
 * <p>
 * A <i><a name="Passive">passive stream source</a></i> is a stream source that is read from by an active sink.
 * For character streams, a passive stream source simply supplies a <code>Reader</code> object.
 * The active sink would typically contain a <code>readFrom(Reader)</code> method which actively reads the entire data stream from the <code>Reader</code> object.
 * <p>
 * The {@link CharStreamSourceUtil#getReader(CharStreamSource)} method converts a <code>CharStreamSource</code> into a <code>Reader</code>,
 * allowing the data from the active <code>CharStreamSource</code> to be consumed by an active sink with a <code>readFrom(Reader)</code> method.
 * <p>
 * Every implementing class must override the {@link #toString()} method to return the output as a string.
 * <p>
 * An easy way to implement this is by calling the {@link CharStreamSourceUtil#toString(CharStreamSource) CharStreamSourceUtil.toString(this)} method,
 * which buffers the output from the {@link #writeTo(Writer)} method into a string.
 *
 * @see OutputDocument
 * @see SourceFormatter
 * @see Renderer
 * @see TextExtractor
